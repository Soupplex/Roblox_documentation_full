Similar to other limitations, the same buffer object cannot be\n  used from multiple Class.Actor scripts (Parallel Luau).\n\n  Many of the functions accept an offset in bytes from the start of the buffer.\n  Offset of 0 from the start of the buffer memory block accesses the first\n  byte. All offsets, counts and sizes should be non-negative integer numbers. If\n  the bytes that are accessed by any read or write operation are outside the\n  buffer memory, an error is thrown.\n\n  The read and write methods that work with integers and floats use\n  little-endian encoding.\ntags: []\ncodesamples: []\nproperties: []\nfunctions:\n  - name: buffer.create\n    summary: |\n      Creates a buffer.\n    description: |\n      Creates a buffer of the requested size with all bytes initialized to 0.\n      Size limit is 1 GiB, or 1,073,741,824 bytes.
