As indicated by the name, it\\n  only affects the **orientation** of the attachments, not their position (to\\n  align attachments **positionally**, see `Class.AlignPosition`).\\n\\n  Torque created by `AlignOrientation` is applied about the center of mass of\\n  the parent of the attachments, or the center of mass of parts rigidly\\n  connected to the parents.\\n\\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\\n  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units\\n  compare to metric units.\\n\\n  #### Affected Axes\\n\\n  The axes affected by torque are controlled through the constraint's\\n  `Class.AlignOrientation.AlignType|AlignType` property. When set to\\n  `Enum.AlignType|PrimaryAxisParallel`,\\n  `Enum.AlignType|PrimaryAxisPerpendicular` or\\n  `Enum.AlignType|PrimaryAxisLookAt`, torque will only occur when the primary\\n  axes become misaligned. Otherwise, the constraint will apply torque about all\\n  3 axes to achieve alignment.\\n\\n  #### Reactionary Torque\\n\\n  By default, the constraint only applies torque to\\n  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` while\\n  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` remains unaffected. If desired,\\n  torque can be applied to both attachments in **equal and opposite directions**\\n  by enabling\\n  `Class.AlignOrientation.ReactionTorqueEnabled|ReactionTorqueEnabled`.\\n\\n  #### Torque Magnitude\\n\\n  You can configure this constraint to apply the maximum torque that constraints\\n  allow through the `Class.AlignOrientation.RigidityEnabled|RigidityEnabled`\\n  property. When `true`, the physics solver reacts as quickly as possible to\\n  complete the alignment. When `false`, the torque is determined by\\n  `Class.AlignOrientation.MaxTorque|MaxTorque`,\\n  `Class.AlignOrientation.MaxAngularVelocity|MaxAngularVelocity`, and\\n  `Class.AlignOrientation.Responsiveness|Responsiveness`.\\n\\n  #### Attachment Mode\\n\\n  This constraint can use either **one** or **two** attachments in calculating\\n  its goal. See `Class.AlignOrientation.Mode|Mode` for details.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Constraint\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: AlignOrientation.AlignType\\n    summary: |\\n      The constraint's axis alignment type.\\n    description: |\\n      Specifies the desired relationship between the primary axes of\\n      `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` and the goal.
