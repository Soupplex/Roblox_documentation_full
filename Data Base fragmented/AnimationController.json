Creates an `Class.Animator` and loads\n  animations to update `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` of said character to react in\n  the way that is described within the animation asset referenced by an\n  `Class.Animation` object.\n\n  Note that the `Class.AnimationController:LoadAnimation()|LoadAnimation()`\n  method of this class has been deprecated. Instead, you should call\n  `Class.Animator:LoadAnimation()` directly from an `Class.Animator` which can\n  be created manually in Studio and directly referenced in scripts. When the\n  deprecated method is called from an `Class.AnimationController`, the\n  controller itself does nothing regarding the animation intended to be loaded,\n  except to automatically generate an `Class.Animator`, onto which the loading\n  call and animation ID are transferred. In this way, the\n  `Class.AnimationController` can be thought of as nothing more than an empty\n  shell for a child `Class.Animator` object which handles any actual\n  functionality regarding animations.\ncode_samples:\n  - AnimationController\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecation_message: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: AnimationController:GetPlayingAnimationTracks\n    summary: |\n      Returns an array of all `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are\n      currently being played by the `Class.AnimationController`.\n    description: |\n      Returns an array of all `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are\n      currently being played by the `Class.AnimationController`.\n\n      A typical use for this function is stopping currently playing tracks using\n      `Class.AnimationTrack:Stop()`.\n\n      Note this function will not return `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks`\n      that have loaded but are not playing. If the developer wishes to track\n      these they will need to index them manually. See below for one example of\n      how this could be achieved:\n\n      ```\n      local animationTracks = {}\n      local track = animationController:LoadTrack(animation)\n      table.insert(animationTracks, track)\n      ```\n    code_samples:\n      - GetPlayingAnimationTracks\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Array\n        summary: |\n          An array of playing `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks`.\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: AnimationController:LoadAnimation\n    summary: |\n      Loads an `Class.Animation` onto an `Class.AnimationController`, returning\n      an `Class.AnimationTrack` that can be used for playback.\n    description: |\n      This function loads an `Class.Animation` onto an\n      `Class.AnimationController`, returning an `Class.AnimationTrack` that can\n      be used for playback.\n    code_samples:\n      - AnimationController\n    parameters:\n      - name: animation\n        type: Animation\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The `Class.Animation` to be used.\n    returns:\n      - type: AnimationTrack\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecation_message: |\n      This function is deprecated in favor of using\n      `Class.Animator:LoadAnimation()` directly (the `Class.Animator` may be\n      created while editing or at runtime).\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\nevents:\n  - name: AnimationController.AnimationPlayed\n    summary: |\n      Fires whenever the `Class.AnimationController` begins playing an\n      animation.
