It behaves similar to a `Class.BodyForce`\\n  except that this object's force applies at a specific point\\n  (`Class.BodyThrust.Location|Location`), allowing you to exert a torque\\n  (rotational force). To apply a force dynamically so that an assembly maintains\\n  a constant angular velocity, use a `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` instead. To\\n  apply a force dynamically so that an assembly maintains a constant orientation\\n  (angular position), use a `Class.BodyGyro`.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecation_message: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
