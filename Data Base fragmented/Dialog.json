The Dialog object can be inserted\n  into a part such as a Humanoid's head, and then a player will see a speech\n  bubble above the part that they can click on to start a conversation. The\n  creator of a place can choose what choices the player can say by inserting\n  Class.DialogChoice objects into the dialog.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Dialog.BehaviorType\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether the Dialog can be used by multiple players at once.\n    description: |\n      The BehaviorType of a Dialog determines whether multiple players can\n      interact with a dialog at once.
