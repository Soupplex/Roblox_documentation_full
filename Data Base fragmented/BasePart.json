There are several\n  implementations of Class.BasePart, the most common being Class.Part and\n  Class.MeshPart. Others include Class.WedgePart, Class.SpawnLocation, and\n  the singleton Class.Terrain object. Generally, when documentation refers to\n  a \"part,\" most Class.BasePart implementations will work and not just\n  Class.Part.\n\n  For information on how Class.BasePart|BaseParts are grouped into simulated\n  rigid bodies, see Assemblies.\n\n  There are many different objects that interact with Class.BasePart (other\n  than Class.Terrain), including:\n\n  - Several Class.BasePart|BaseParts may be grouped within a Class.Model and\n    moved at the same time using Class.PVInstance:PivotTo(). See\n    Models.\n  - A Class.Decal applies a stretched image texture to the faces of a\n    Class.BasePart, while a Class.Texture applies a tiled image texture to\n    the faces. See Textures and Decals.\n  - A Class.SurfaceGui renders Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects on the face of a\n    part. See\n    In-Experience UI Containers.\n  - Class.Attachment|Attachments can be added to a Class.BasePart to specify\n    Datatype.CFrame|CFrames relative to the part. These are often used by\n    physical Class.Constraint objects as outlined in\n    Mechanical Constraints and\n    Mover Constraints.\n  - Class.ParticleEmitter objects emit particles uniformly in the volume of\n    the Class.BasePart to which they are parented. See\n    Particle Emitters.\n  - Light objects like Class.PointLight emit light from the center of a\n    Class.BasePart as illustrated in\n    Light Sources.\n  - If parented to a Class.Tool and given the name Handle, a\n    Class.BasePart can be held by characters.

When enabled, a part will never change position due to gravity,\n      other part collisions, overlapping other parts, or any other\n      physics-related causes. As a result, two anchored parts will never fire\n      the Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched event on each other.\n\n      An anchored part may still be moved by changing its\n      Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame or Class.BasePart.Position|Position, and\n      it still may have a nonzero\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity and\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity.\n\n      Finally, if an unanchored part is joined with an anchored part through an\n      object like a Class.Weld, it too will act anchored. If such a joint\n      breaks, the part may be affected by physics again. See\n      Assemblies for more details.\n\n      Network ownership cannot be set on anchored parts. If a part's anchored\n      status changes on the server, the network ownership of that part will be\n      affected.\n    codesamples:\n      - Part-Anchored-Toggle\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Part\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity\n    summary: |\n      The angular velocity of the part's assembly.\n    description: |\n      The angular velocity vector of this part's assembly.
