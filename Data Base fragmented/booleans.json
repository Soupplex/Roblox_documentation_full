    "content": "The boolean data type, or bool, has a value of either true or false.\n\nConditionals\n\nIf a value isn't false or nil, Luau evaluates it as true in conditional statements. Unlike many other languages, Luau considers both zero and the empty string as true.\n\nOperators\n\nYou can formulate complex conditions with relational and logical operators.",
