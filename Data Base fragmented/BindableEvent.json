When you fire a\\n  `Class.BindableEvent` through the `Class.BindableEvent:Fire()` method, the\\n  firing script does **not** yield and the target function receives the passed\\n  arguments with certain [limitations](#argument-limitations).\\n  `Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents` create threads of each connected\\n  function, so even if one firing errors, others continue.\\n\\n  As an alternative for two-way communication between two scripts on the same\\n  side of the client-server boundary, consider `Class.BindableFunction`.\\n\\n  As stated, `Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents` do not allow for communication\\n  between the server and clients. If you are looking for this functionality, use\\n  a `Class.RemoteEvent` as outlined in\\n  [Remote Events and Callbacks](../../../scripting/events/remote.md).\\n\\n  See [Bindable events and callbacks](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md) for\\n  code samples and further details on `Class.BindableEvent`.\\n\\n  #### Parameter Limitations\\n\\n  Any type of Roblox object such as an `Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, or\\n  others can be passed as a parameter when a `Class.BindableEvent` is fired, as\\n  well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should\\n  carefully explore the\\n  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md#argument-limitations).\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties: []\\nmethods:\\n  - name: BindableEvent:Fire\\n    summary: |\\n      Fires the `Class.BindableEvent` which in turn fires the\\n      `Class.BindableEvent.Event|Event` event.\\n    description: |\\n      Fires the `Class.BindableEvent` which in turn fires the\\n      `Class.BindableEvent.Event|Event` event.
