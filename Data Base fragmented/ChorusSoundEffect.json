It does this by taking the original sound and\n  overlaying copies of that sound. These copies are not exact matches to the\n  original but instead vary in pitch slightly. This simulates a real chorus, as\n  different singers or instruments will have slight variations. This effect can\n  be applied to either an individual sound or to a sound group by parenting it\n  to the desired instance.\n\n  Like all other Class.SoundEffect, a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either\n  to a Class.Sound or Class.SoundGroup by being parented to either.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SoundEffect\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ChorusSoundEffect.Depth\n    summary: |\n      Controls how intense the effect is.\n    description: |\n      Range: 0 to 1 (default 0.15) Controls how intense the effect is.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - LegacySound\n  - name: ChorusSoundEffect.Mix\n    summary: |\n      Percentage of the original sound that will be applied to the filter.\n    description: |\n      Range: 0 to 1 (default 0.5) Percentage of the original sound that will be\n      applied to the filter.
