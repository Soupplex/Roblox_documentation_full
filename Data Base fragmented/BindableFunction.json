Scripts invoking a\n  Class.BindableFunction yield until the corresponding callback is found.\ndescription: |\n  The BindableFunction object allows for synchronous two-way communication\n  between scripts on the same side of the\n  client-server boundary. You can use it\n  to define a custom callback function and invoke it manually by calling\n  Class.BindableFunction:Invoke(). The code invoking the function yields\n  until the corresponding callback is found, and the callback receives the\n  arguments that you passed to Class.BindableFunction:Invoke()|Invoke(). If\n  the callback was never set, the script that invokes it will not resume\n  execution.\n\n  As an alternative for one-way communication between two scripts on the same\n  side of the client-server boundary, consider Class.BindableEvent which does\n  not yield for a return.\n\n  As stated, Class.BindableFunction|BindableFunctions do not allow for\n  communication between the server and clients. If you are looking for this\n  functionality, use a Class.RemoteFunction as outlined in\n  Remote events and callbacks.\n\n  See Bindable events and callbacks for\n  code samples and further details on Class.BindableFunction.\n\n  #### Parameter Limitations\n\n  Any type of Roblox object such as an Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, or\n  others can be passed as a parameter when a Class.BindableFunction is\n  invoked, as well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans,\n  although you should carefully explore the\n  limitations.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: BindableFunction:Invoke\n    summary: |\n      Invokes the Class.BindableFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.BindableFunction.OnInvoke|OnInvoke callback, returning any values\n      returned by the callback.\n    description: |\n      Invokes the Class.BindableFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.BindableFunction.OnInvoke|OnInvoke callback, returning any values\n      returned by the callback.
