This\\n  allows for the creation of assemblies that continually rotate. It is the\\n  rotational counterpart to a `Class.BodyVelocity`. If you would like to\\n  maintain a constant angular displacement, use a `Class.BodyGyro` instead.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecation_message: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
