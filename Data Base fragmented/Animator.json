These relative velocity\n      calculations and assignments happen in the order provided.\n\n      This method doesn't apply velocities for a given joint if both of the\n      joint's parts are currently part of the same assembly, for example, if\n      they are still connected directly or indirectly by Motors or Welds.\n\n      This method doesn't disable or remove the joints for you. You must disable\n      or otherwise remove the rigid joints from the assembly before calling this\n      method.\n\n      The given `Motor6Ds` are not required to be descendants of the\n      `Class.DataModel`. Removing the joints from the `Class.DataModel` before\n      calling this method is supported.\n    code_samples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: motors\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: Animator:GetPlayingAnimationTracks\n    summary: |\n      Returns the list of currently playing\n      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks`.\n    description: |\n      Returns the list of currently playing\n      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks`.\n    code_samples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Array\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: Animator:LoadAnimation\n    summary: |\n      Loads an `Class.Animation` onto an `Class.Animator`, returning an\n      `Class.AnimationTrack`.\n    description: |\n      This function loads the given `Class.Animation` onto this\n      `Class.Animator`, returning a playable `Class.AnimationTrack`. When called\n      on an `Class.Animator` within models that the client has network ownership\n      of, for example the local player's character or from\n      `Class.BasePart:SetNetworkOwner()`, this function also loads the animation\n      for the server as well.\n\n      Note that the `Class.Animator` must be in the `Class.Workspace` before\n      making a call to `LoadAnimation()` or else it will be unable to retrieve\n      the `Class.AnimationClipProvider` service and throw an error.\n\n      You should use this function directly instead of the similarly-named\n      `Class.Humanoid:LoadAnimation()` and\n      `Class.AnimationController:LoadAnimation()` functions. These are\n      deprecated proxies of this function which also create an `Class.Animator`\n      if one does not exist; this can cause replication issues if you are not\n      careful.\n\n      #### Loading an Animation on Client or Server\n\n      In order for `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` to replicate\n      correctly, it's important to know when they should be loaded on the client\n      or on the server:\n\n      - If an `Class.Animator` is a descendant of a `Class.Humanoid` or\n        `Class.AnimationController` in a player's `Class.Player.Character`,\n        animations started on that player's client will be replicated to the\n        server and other clients.\n\n      - If the `Class.Animator` is **not** a descendant of a player character,\n        its animations must be loaded and started on the server to replicate.\n\n      The `Class.Animator` object must be initially created on the server and\n      replicated to clients for animation replication to work at all. If an\n      `Class.Animator` is created locally, then\n      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` loaded with that `Class.Animator`\n      will not replicate.\n    code_samples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: animation\n        type: Animation\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The `Class.Animation` to be used.\n    returns:\n      - type: AnimationTrack\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: Animator:RegisterEvaluationParallelCallback\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    code_samples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: callback\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: Animator:StepAnimations\n    summary: |\n      Increments the `Class.AnimationTrack.TimePosition` of all playing\n      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are loaded onto the\n      `Class.Animator`, applying the offsets to the model associated with the\n      `Class.Animator`. For use in the command bar or by plugins only.\n    description: |\n      Increments the `Class.AnimationTrack.TimePosition` of all playing\n      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are loaded onto the\n      `Class.Animator`, applying the offsets to the model associated with the\n      `Class.Animator`. For use in the command bar or by plugins only.\n\n      The deltaTime parameter determines the number of seconds to increment on\n      the animation's progress. Typically this function will be called in a loop\n      to preview the length of an animation (see example).\n\n      Note that once animations have stopped playing, the model's joints will\n      need to be manually reset to their original positions (see example).\n\n      This function is used to simulate playback of `Class.Animation|Animations`\n      when the game isn't running. This allows animations to be previewed\n      without the consequences of running the game, such as scripts executing.\n      If the function is called while the game is running, or by\n      `Class.Script|Scripts` or `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, it will return\n      an error.\n\n      Developers designing their own custom animation editors are advised to use\n      this function to preview animations, as it is the method the official\n      Roblox Animation Editor plugin uses.\n    code_samples:\n      - Animator-StepAnimations\n    parameters:\n      - name: deltaTime\n        type: float\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The amount of time in seconds animation playback is to be incremented\n          by.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    thread_safety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\nevents:\n  - name: Animator.AnimationPlayed\n    summary: |\n      Fires when the Animator starts playing an AnimationTrack.\n    description: |\n      Fires for all `Class.AnimationTrack:Play()` calls on AnimationTracks\n      created and owned by the Animator.\n    code_samples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: animationTrack\n        type: AnimationTrack\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecation_message: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\ncallbacks: []"
