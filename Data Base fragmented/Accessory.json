It typically has a child Handle with a\\n  child Attachment and a WrapLayer in the case of Layered Clothing.\\n\\n  The Accessory class is the successor to the legacy Hat system. It's\\n  cross-compatible with both the legacy R6 character system and the new R15\\n  character system.\\n\\n  If you insert an `Class.Attachment` into the Accessory's Handle with the same\\n  name as an `Class.Attachment` in one of the character's limbs, they connect\\n  and ignore properties inherited from the `Class.Accoutrement` class.\\n  Otherwise, the Accessory functions identically to a `Class.Hat`.\\n\\n  Note: If there are two matching `Attachments`, the resulting `Class.Weld` is a\\n  child of the Accessory's Handle. This differs from the legacy behavior of Hats\\n  where the Weld is always a child of the Head of the character.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Accoutrement\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: Accessory.AccessoryType\\n    summary: |\\n      Specifies the AccessoryType of the Accessory (eg.
