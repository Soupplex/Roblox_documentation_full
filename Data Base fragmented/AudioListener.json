It provides a single\\n  **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. If\\n  the parent is an `Class.Attachment`, `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`,\\n  the parent's world `Datatype.CFrame` will be used for listening. If the parent\\n  is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioListener` effectively hears\\n  nothing.\\ncode_samples:\\n  - audio-wiring---camera-listener\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: AudioListener.AcousticSimulationEnabled\\n    summary: ''\\n    description: ''\\n    code_samples: []\\n    type: boolean\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecation_message: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    thread_safety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Simulation\\n    serialization:\\n      can_load: true\\n      can_save: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Audio\\n  - name: AudioListener.AngleAttenuation\\n    summary: |\\n      Represents how the perceived volume of the emitted sound changes based on\\n      the angle between a `Class.AudioEmitter` and the\\n      `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector` associated with the\\n      `Class.AudioListener`.\\n    description: |\\n      Represents a volume-over-angle curve that affects how loudly a\\n      `Class.AudioListener` will hear the `Class.AudioEmitter`, based on the\\n      angle between them and the `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector`\\n      associated with the `Class.AudioListener`.\\n\\n      This property is internal and can't be accessed by scripts; it exists to\\n      support replication.
