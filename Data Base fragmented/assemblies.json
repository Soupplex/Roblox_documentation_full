This is the part that doesn't move when `Class.Motor6D` transforms are updated, as well as the part used to keep consistent physics replication and network ownership.\\n\\nYou cannot explicitly set the root part, but the following factors affect probability from highest to lowest:\\n\\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={2} Medium={1} Large={1} XLarge={1}><img src=\\\"../assets/misc/Arrow-Higher.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"50\\\" style={{float:\\\"right\\\"}} /></Grid>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={10} Medium={11} Large={11} XLarge={11} style={{marginTop:\\\"4px\\\"}}>\\n\\tAn `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` part will always be assigned as the root part.\\n\\t</Grid>\\n</Grid>\\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={2} Medium={1} Large={1} XLarge={1}><img src=\\\"../assets/misc/Arrow-High.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"50\\\" style={{float:\\\"right\\\"}} /></Grid>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={10} Medium={11} Large={11} XLarge={11} style={{marginTop:\\\"4px\\\"}}>\\n\\tParts with `Class.BasePart.Massless|Massless` set to **false** (default) take precedence.\\n\\t</Grid>\\n</Grid>\\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={2} Medium={1} Large={1} XLarge={1}><img src=\\\"../assets/misc/Arrow-Low.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"50\\\" style={{float:\\\"right\\\"}} /></Grid>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={10} Medium={11} Large={11} XLarge={11} style={{marginTop:\\\"4px\\\"}}>\\n\\tHigher `Class.BasePart.RootPriority|RootPriority` values take precedence.\\n\\t</Grid>\\n</Grid>\\n<Grid container spacing={2}>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={2} Medium={1} Large={1} XLarge={1}><img src=\\\"../assets/misc/Arrow-Lower.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"50\\\" style={{float:\\\"right\\\"}} /></Grid>\\n\\t<Grid item XSmall={10} Medium={11} Large={11} XLarge={11} style={{marginTop:\\\"4px\\\"}}>\\n\\tPrecedence based on the part's size, with multipliers for parts with specific names.\\n\\t</Grid>\\n</Grid>\\n\\n## Anchoring behavior\\n\\nWhen one of an assembly's parts is anchored, that part becomes the root part and all of the other parts become implicitly anchored with it. The following sequence illustrates this behavior.\\n\\n1. Below, four parts are welded together with `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints` (green&nbsp;bars) to form a single assembly, as indicated by the matching colored outlines.\\n\\n   <figure>\\n     <img src=\\\"../assets/physics/assemblies/Assembly-Anchor-Diagram-1.png\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" />\\n     <figcaption>Four parts welded to become a single assembly</figcaption>\\n   </figure>\\n\\n2. If just **one** part in the assembly is anchored, the assembly will not change, other than the root part potentially changing (the&nbsp;anchored part always has the highest [priority](#assembly-root-part) for becoming the root&nbsp;part).\\n\\n   <figure>\\n     <img src=\\\"../assets/physics/assemblies/Assembly-Anchor-Diagram-2.png\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" />\\n     <figcaption>Anchored part (as indicated with an anchor icon) becomes the new root part</figcaption>\\n   </figure>\\n\\n3. If more than one part is anchored, the assembly will **split**. Below, both the left and top parts are anchored, so the original assembly splits into two assemblies as shown by the colored outlines. Also, the `Class.WeldConstraint` between the two assemblies deactivates, since you cannot have an active weld between two anchored assemblies.\\n\\n   <figure>\\n     <img src=\\\"../assets/physics/assemblies/Assembly-Anchor-Diagram-3.png\\\" width=\\\"720\\\" />\\n     <figcaption>Two assemblies with anchored parts as their respective root parts</figcaption>\\n   </figure>\\n\\n   <Alert severity=\\\"warning\\\">\\n   If you want to anchor all parts in an assembly, you only need to anchor the assembly's root part. Anchoring all parts is actually less performant, as it creates more assemblies.\\n   </Alert>\"\n}"
