It\n  provides one Input pin and one Output pin which can be connected\n  to/from by Class.Wire|Wires. Class.AudioEqualizer has 3 frequency bands\n  whose gain values can be controlled, and the crossover points between bands\n  can be moved.\ncodesamples:\n  - audio-wiring---listener-equalization\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AudioEqualizer.Bypass\n    summary: |\n      Whether audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    description: |\n      If true, audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Audio\n  - name: AudioEqualizer.HighGain\n    summary: |\n      Gain value to be applied to the frequency content of the highest band in\n      the equalizer.\n    description: |\n      Gain value, in decibels, to be applied to the frequency content of the\n      highest band in the equalizer.
