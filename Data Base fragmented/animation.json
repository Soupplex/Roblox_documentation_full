If an\n  Class.Animator is created locally, then\n  Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks loaded with that Class.Animator will\n  not replicate.\n\n  See also Animation Editor and\n  Using Animations to learn how to create and add\n  pre-built or custom animations to your game.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Animation.AnimationId\n    summary: |\n      Asset ID of the animation an Class.Animation object is referencing.\n    description: |\n      This property is the asset ID of the animation an Class.Animation object\n      is referencing.
