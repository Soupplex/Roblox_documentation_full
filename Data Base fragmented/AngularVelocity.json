Alternatively:\n\n  - If you want to control the amount of torque applied, use a Class.Torque\n    constraint.\n  - If you only need initial angular velocity, set the\n    Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity method\n    directly on the assembly.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Relativity\n\n  Application of velocity can be controlled through the constraint's\n  Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo property. If set to\n  Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World, the angular velocity vector is used as is. If\n  set to Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1 and the constraint's\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 property is set to another\n  attachment, the angular velocity will be affected by that of the other\n  attachment. Setting Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo to\n  Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1 also exposes the\n  Class.AngularVelocity.ReactionTorqueEnabled|ReactionTorqueEnabled property.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AngularVelocity.AngularVelocity\n    summary: |\n      A Datatype.Vector3 that gives the desired or target angular velocity.\n    description: |\n      A Datatype.Vector3 that gives the desired or target angular velocity.\n      This vector is set in the Datatype.CFrame expressed by the\n      Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo property.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Torque\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: AngularVelocity.MaxTorque\n    summary: |\n      Magnitude of the maximum torque the constraint can apply.\n    description: |\n      Magnitude of the maximum torque the constraint can apply.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Torque\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: AngularVelocity.ReactionTorqueEnabled\n    summary: |\n      Causes the constraint to apply equal and opposite reaction forces.\n    description: |\n      This property, when enabled, causes the constraint to apply equal and\n      opposite reaction forces. This is important if the two attached parts can\n      collide, since without reaction forces collisions can create energy that\n      would otherwise be disregarded.\n\n      When enabled, the reaction forces cause the constraint to act like an\n      angular motor between the two attachments.\n\n      Only meaningful when Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo is set\n      to Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Torque\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: AngularVelocity.RelativeTo\n    summary: ''\n    description: |\n      The Datatype.CFrame in which the AngularVelocity force is specified.\n      If set to Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World, the angular velocity vector is\n      used as is.
