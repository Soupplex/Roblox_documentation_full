It provides a single\\n  **Input** pin that can be connected to by one or more `Class.Wire|Wires`. Any\\n  streams wired to an `Class.AudioEmitter` get broadcasted into the world from\\n  the emitter's parent's position. If the parent is an `Class.Attachment`,\\n  `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`, the parent's world-position will be\\n  used. If the parent is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioEmitter` is\\n  effectively silent.\\n\\n  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` are heard by\\n  `Class.AudioListener|AudioListeners` in order to implement 3D spatialization.\\ncode_samples:\\n  - audio-wiring---multi-emission\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: AudioEmitter.AcousticSimulationEnabled\\n    summary: ''\\n    description: ''\\n    code_samples: []\\n    type: boolean\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecation_message: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    thread_safety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Simulation\\n    serialization:\\n      can_load: true\\n      can_save: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Audio\\n  - name: AudioEmitter.AngleAttenuation\\n    summary: |\\n      Represents how the perceived volume of the emitted sound changes based on\\n      the angle between a `Class.AudioListener` and the\\n      `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector` associated with the\\n      `Class.AudioEmitter`.\\n    description: |\\n      Represents a volume-over-angle curve that affects how loudly a\\n      `Class.AudioListener` will hear the `Class.AudioEmitter`, based on the\\n      angle between them and the `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector`\\n      associated with the `Class.AudioEmitter`.\\n\\n      This property is internal and can't be accessed by scripts; it exists to\\n      support replication.
