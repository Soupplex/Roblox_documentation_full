Other experiences make limited [modifications](../characters/appearance.md) to player avatars such as helmets, wings, or accessories that match the genre.\\n\\nTo create a unique experience that alters the appearance of your users, you can customize the default character properties through [avatar settings](#global-avatar-settings) or a [manually modify appearance](#manually-modify-appearance).\\n\\n## Global avatar settings\\n\\nStudio's **File**&nbsp;⟩ **Avatar Settings** allows you to quickly set several global player character properties in your experience. These settings apply globally to all player character models joining your experience. To modify specific characters, such as non-player character models, see [manually modify appearance](#manually-modify-appearance).\\n\\nIn this window, you can set various presets for clothing, accessories, body parts, collision behavior, animations and more. When editing these settings, a preview of the applied settings displays in the workspace.\\n\\nFor more information, see [Avatar Settings](../studio/avatar-settings.md).\\n\\n## Manually modify appearance\\n\\nCharacter models contain a `Class.Humanoid` object that gives the model special characteristics, such as walking, jumping, equipping items, and interacting with the environment.\\n\\nYou can programmatically modify a `Class.Humanoid` by updating `Class.HumanoidDescription`. This includes player character models or non-player character models in your experience.\\n\\nYou can adjust the following character properties in your experience using `Class.HumanoidDescription`:\\n\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n  <tr>\\n    <th>Character property</th>\\n    <th>Description</th>\\n  </tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td>Scale</td>\\n    <td>Number values for physical traits `Class.HumanoidDescription.HeightScale|height`, `Class.HumanoidDescription.WidthScale|width`, `Class.HumanoidDescription.HeadScale|head`, `Class.HumanoidDescription.BodyTypeScale|body type` and `Class.HumanoidDescription.ProportionScale|proportion`.

[Create a description](#create-humanoiddescription) from the user's character, a specific Outfit ID, or from a specific User ID.\\n2. [Modify the description](#modify-humanoiddescription) to customize the properties that you want to apply to the `Class.Humanoid` character.\\n3. [Apply the description](#apply-humanoiddescription) on either a single character, all player characters, or even on all spawning characters.\\n\\n<Alert severity=\\\"warning\\\">\\nWhen updating a character's properties through `Class.HumanoidDescription`, it is important to use an up-to-date `Class.HumanoidDescription` of that specific `Class.Humanoid` with `Class.Humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()|Humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()`.\\n</Alert>\\n\\n### Create HumanoidDescription\\n\\nYou can create a new `Class.HumanoidDescription` instance directly within the **Explorer** hierarchy or within a `Class.Script` with the following code:\\n\\n```lua title=\\\"Create new HumanoidDescription instance\\\"\\nlocal humanoidDescription = Instance.new(\\\"HumanoidDescription\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIn most cases, you should use an existing `Class.HumanoidDescription` instead of a default new `Class.HumanoidDescription` by referencing an existing player character, avatar outfit, or user ID.\\n\\n<br />\\n<h4> From the player character </h4>\\n\\nUse the following code sample to create a new `Class.HumanoidDescription` based on the player character's current properties:\\n\\n```lua title=\\\"Generate a HumanoidDescription from a player character\\\"\\nlocal humanoid = player.Character and player.Character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA(\\\"Humanoid\\\")\\n\\nlocal humanoidDescription = Instance.new(\\\"HumanoidDescription\\\")\\n\\nif humanoid then\\n\\thumanoidDescription = humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()\\nend\\n```\\n\\n<h4> From an existing outfit </h4>\\n\\nUse the following sample code to create a `Class.HumanoidDescription` from an outfit ID using `Class.Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromOutfitId()|Players.GetHumanoidDescriptionFromOutfitID`:\\n\\n```lua title=\\\"Generate a HumanoidDescription from an Outfit ID\\\"\\nlocal Players = game:GetService(\\\"Players\\\")\\n\\nlocal outfitId = 480059254\\n\\nlocal humanoidDescriptionFromOutfit = Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromOutfitId(outfitId)\\n```\\n\\n<h4> From a specific user </h4>\\n\\nUse the following sample code to create a `Class.HumanoidDescription` from a user ID using `Class.Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromUserId()`:\\n\\n```lua  title=\\\"Generate a HumanoidDescription from a user ID\\\"\\nlocal Players = game:GetService(\\\"Players\\\")\\n\\nlocal userId = 491243243\\n\\nlocal humanoidDescriptionFromUser = Players:GetHumanoidDescriptionFromUserId(userId)\\n```\\n\\n### Modify HumanoidDescription\\n\\nTo customize `Class.HumanoidDescription` properties, set them directly on the `Class.HumanoidDescription` or use a specified method before applying the `Class.HumanoidDescription` to a character.\\n\\nThe following code sample provides examples of setting the different types of `Class.HumanoidDescription` properties:\\n\\n```lua title=\\\"Update various HumanoidDescription properties\\\"\\nlocal humanoidDescription = Instance.new(\\\"HumanoidDescription\\\")\\nhumanoidDescription.HatAccessory = \\\"2551510151,2535600138\\\"\\nhumanoidDescription.BodyTypeScale = 0.1\\nhumanoidDescription.ClimbAnimation = 619521311\\nhumanoidDescription.Face = 86487700\\nhumanoidDescription.GraphicTShirt = 1711661\\nhumanoidDescription.HeadColor = Color3.new(0, 1, 0)\\n```\\n\\n<h4> Set multiple accessories </h4>\\n\\nFor layered or bulk accessory changes, you can use `Class.HumanoidDescription:SetAccessories()` to make accessory related updates.

Layered accessories can work with both standard [R15 Roblox characters](../characters/index.md#avatar-characters) and non-R15 models.\\n\\nCustom implementation of layered clothing, such as a model using a unique cage UV map, cannot be uploaded and published to the Marketplace. For more information, see [Layered clothing specifications](../art/accessories/clothing-specifications.md).\\n\\nWhether you are implementing layered accessories on an avatar R15 rig, or using a custom rig, ensure that your accessories and bodies include the following:\\n\\n- The target model, typically the body, has a `Class.WrapTarget` component on the meshes that additional models are intended to wrap around.\\n- The layering model, typically the clothing or accessory, has a `Class.WrapLayer` component on the meshes meant to wrap the target model.\\n- The **outer cage of the target model**, and the **inner and outer cage of the layering model** have matching UV maps.\\n  - The corresponding vertices on the target cage should have the same UVs as those vertices on the layer cage.\\n- If your target model is not R15, or doesn't include a `Class.Humanoid`, you must add a `Class.Weld` object to the layering `Class.MeshPart`.\\n  - The `Class.Weld` must have `Part0` and `Part1` set to link the layering MeshPart to the Part hierarchy of the Model. For example, `Part0` refers to the accessory and `Part1` refers to the parent Part.\\n- If your target model is both R15 and includes a `Class.Humanoid`, this weld is created automatically.\\n\\n<Alert severity = 'info'>\\nSee the following resources for additional information on layered clothing and caging:\\n\\n- [Layered clothing caging overview](../art/accessories/layered-clothing.md#inner-and-outer-cages)\\n- [Layered clothing caging best practices](../art/accessories/caging-best-practices.md)\\n- [Layered clothing cage mesh specifications](../art/accessories/clothing-specifications.md#cage-meshes)\\n- [Avatar body cage specifications](../art/characters/specifications.md#outer-cages)\\n\\n</Alert>\"\n}"
