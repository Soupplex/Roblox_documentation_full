It is primarily used for\n  sending data to a character controller. Using a Class.ControllerPartSensor\n  allows you to detect Class.BasePart|BaseParts in the same manner as the\n  Class.Humanoid uses for detecting floors and ladders.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - ControllerSensor\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ControllerPartSensor.HitFrame\n    summary: |\n      The position in world space where the sensor hit the\n      Class.ControllerPartSensor.SensedPart.\n    description: |\n      The position in world space where the sensor hit the\n      Class.ControllerPartSensor.SensedPart.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Output\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: ControllerPartSensor.HitNormal\n    summary: |\n      The surface normal at the position where the sensor hit the\n      Class.ControllerPartSensor.SensedPart.\n    description: |\n      The surface normal at the position where the sensor hit the SensedPart.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Output\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: ControllerPartSensor.SearchDistance\n    summary: |\n      The distance from the sensor's parent Class.BasePart to use when sensing\n      other parts.\n    description: |\n      The distance from the sensor's parent Class.BasePart to use when sensing\n      other parts.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Input\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: ControllerPartSensor.SensedPart\n    summary: |\n      A reference to the Class.BasePart hit by the sensor.\n    description: |\n      A reference to the Class.BasePart hit by the sensor.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: BasePart\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Output\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: ControllerPartSensor.SensorMode\n    summary: |\n      Determines what behavior this Class.SensorBase uses when sensing other\n      parts.\n    description: |\n      Determines what behavior this Class.SensorBase uses when sensing other\n      parts.\n\n      A setting of Enum.SensorMode.Ladder performs the same ladder detection\n      logic used by a Class.Humanoid to populate sensor output.
