The offset is\\n  stored in the `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` property. The offset can also\\n  be set through other properties, such as\\n  `Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame`.\\n\\n  If no ancestral `Class.PVInstance` or `Class.Attachment` exists, then\\n  `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` and\\n  `Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame` are the same.\\n\\n  Attachments are used by several kinds of `Class.Constraint|Constraints` and\\n  are also valid alternatives to `Class.BasePart` as a parent for objects such\\n  as:\\n\\n  - `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters` which will emit particles from the\\n    attachment's specific position/orientation instead of the `Class.BasePart`\\n    bounds.\\n\\n  - Light-emitting objects like `Class.PointLight` and `Class.SpotLight` which\\n    will shine from the attachment's position/orientation instead of the\\n    `Class.BasePart` center.\\n\\n  - `Class.AudioEmitter` which will use the attachment's position as the audio's\\n    point of emission.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants:\\n  - Bone\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: Attachment.Axis\\n    summary: |\\n      Direction of the **X** axis of the attachment, represented as a unit\\n      `Datatype.Vector3`.\\n    description: |\\n      Direction of the **X** axis of the attachment, represented as a unit\\n      `Datatype.Vector3`.\\n    code_samples: []\\n    type: Vector3\\n    tags:\\n      - NotReplicated\\n    deprecation_message: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    thread_safety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Derived Data\\n    serialization:\\n      can_load: true\\n      can_save: false\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Basic\\n  - name: Attachment.CFrame\\n    summary: |\\n      `Datatype.CFrame` offset of the attachment.\\n    description: |\\n      The `Datatype.CFrame` offset of the attachment.
