You can change the position and rotation of the Handle\n  part using the Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentPos|AttachmentPos,\n  Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentRight|Right,\n  Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentForward|Forward, and\n  Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentUp|Up properties.\n\n  Parts descending from an accoutrement are massless when attach to other parts\n  (e.g. with a Weld) as long as they are not the root part of the assembly that\n  Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()|GetRootPart() returns.\n  Class.BasePart:GetMass()|GetMass() returns 0 for parts in this case, and it\n  doesn't add to the total mass or rotational inertia of the Assembly.\n\n  This doesn't apply to a part descending from an accoutrement when an\n  accoutrement welds to another part that is massless or one if its parts\n  otherwise becomes root. This also doesn't apply for the root part, and it has\n  mass like a normal part.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - Accessory\n  - Hat\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Accoutrement.AttachmentForward\n    summary: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    description: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n  - name: Accoutrement.AttachmentPoint\n    summary: |\n      The exact CFrame of the Accoutrement.\n    description: |\n      The exact CFrame of the Accoutrement.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n  - name: Accoutrement.AttachmentPos\n    summary: |\n      Sets the position of the object on the Player.\n    description: |\n      Sets the position of the object on the Player.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n  - name: Accoutrement.AttachmentRight\n    summary: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    description: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n  - name: Accoutrement.AttachmentUp\n    summary: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    description: |\n      Sets the offset position of the object on the Player.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
