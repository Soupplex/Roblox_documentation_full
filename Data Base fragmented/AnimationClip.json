To simplify the use of\n  Roblox's animation system, all such representations are their own instance\n  types but inherit from the `Class.AnimationClip` instance. Animation clips\n  published to Roblox via the [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md)\n  can be loaded into the Roblox Engine using an `Class.Animation` instance.\ncode_samples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - CurveAnimation\n  - KeyframeSequence\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecation_message: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AnimationClip.Loop\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the animation stored in this `Class.AnimationClip` is\n      intended to loop.\n    description: |\n      Determines whether the animation stored in this `Class.AnimationClip` is\n      intended to loop.
