As indicated by the name, it\\n  only affects the **position** of the attachments, not their orientation (to\\n  align attachments by **orientation**, see `Class.AlignOrientation`).\\n\\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\\n  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units\\n  compare to metric units.\\n\\n  #### Force Location\\n\\n  By default, force is applied to the parent of\\n  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` at that attachment's location,\\n  meaning that if the parent's center of mass is not aligned with the direction\\n  of the force, torque will be applied as well as force. Alternatively, force\\n  can be applied to the parents' center of mass by toggling on\\n  `Class.AlignPosition.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass`.\\n\\n  #### Reactionary Force\\n\\n  By default, the constraint only applies force to\\n  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` while\\n  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` remains unaffected. If desired,\\n  force can be applied to both attachments in **equal and opposite directions**\\n  by enabling `Class.AlignPosition.ReactionForceEnabled|ReactionForceEnabled`.\\n\\n  #### Force Limits\\n\\n  You can configure this constraint to apply the maximum force that constraints\\n  allow through the `Class.AlignPosition.RigidityEnabled|RigidityEnabled`\\n  property. When `true`, the physics solver reacts as quickly as possible to\\n  complete the alignment. When `false`, the force applied by the constraint is\\n  limited based on `Class.AlignPosition.ForceLimitMode|ForceLimitMode`,\\n  `Class.AlignPosition.MaxVelocity|MaxVelocity`, and\\n  `Class.AlignPosition.Responsiveness|Responsiveness`. See\\n  `Class.AlignPosition.ForceLimitMode|ForceLimitMode` for further details.\\n\\n  #### Attachment Mode\\n\\n  This constraint can use either **one** or **two** attachments in calculating\\n  its goal. See `Class.AlignPosition.Mode|Mode` for details.\\ncode_samples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Constraint\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecation_message: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: AlignPosition.ApplyAtCenterOfMass\\n    summary: |\\n      Whether force is applied to the parent of\\n      `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` at that attachment's location,\\n      or at the parents' center of mass.\\n    description: |\\n      When `false` (default), force is applied to the parent of\\n      `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` at that attachment's location,\\n      meaning that if the parent's center of mass is not aligned with the\\n      direction of the force, torque will be applied as well as force.
