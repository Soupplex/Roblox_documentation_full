    "content": "There is a newer set of audio objects and effects that offer more control and address robust use cases. For more information, see Audio.\n\nSound effects and music enhance your experiences and make them more immersive. You can import your own audio assets or search for free-to-use audio in the Creator Store, play audio through Class.Sound or objects, and enhance audio playback through dynamic effects.\n\nSound objects\n\nA sound object emits audio within an experience. Roblox assigns each audio asset a unique ID that you can assign to Class.Sound objects to play a specific sound effect or music track. You can either set this audio to play automatically at runtime, or trigger it to play from scripts.\n\nThe location of where you place a Class.Sound object in the Explorer hierarchy affects how users hear audio. If you want users to only hear audio near a specific position, you must parent the Class.Sound object to a 3D object or Class.Attachment to behave as positional audio. If you want users to hear audio regardless of their position, you must insert the Class.Sound object directly into Class.Workspace or Class.SoundService to behave as background audio.\n\nSound groups\n\nA sound group acts as an audio mixer for multiple audio objects, such as Class.Sound objects or additional Class.SoundGroup|SoundGroups, allowing you to control the volume and dynamic effects properties of multiple audio signals at once.\n\nDynamic effects\n\nDynamic effects modify or enhance the audio of individual Class.Sound objects or an entire Class.SoundGroup. You can apply these effects to make audio more immersive within the experience, such as using Class.EqualizerSoundEffect to make rain sound muffled, Class.CompressorSoundEffect to control a sound's maximum volume, or Class.ReverbSoundEffect to add more realistic reflections of sound in interior spaces.",
