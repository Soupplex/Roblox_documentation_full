Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\\n\\nA Class.CylindricalConstraint allows its attachments to slide along one axis and rotate about another axis. This constraint, along with a\\nSpringConstraint, is ideal for building vehicle suspensions where the wheel shock can slide up and down while the wheel itself spins. This constraint can also be powered in both an angular and linear manner.\\n\\nOrientation of the attachments affects how the cylindrical aspect will rotate. To ensure rotation occurs around the desired axis, each attachment's Class.Attachment.Axis|Axis and Class.Attachment.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis, visualized by the yellow and orange arrows, should point in the same direction.\\n\\nAngular power\\n\\nIf a cylindrical's Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to rotate the attachments with the goal of reaching its Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity. You can further control this rotation through both Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxAngularAcceleration|MotorMaxAngularAcceleration and Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxTorque|MotorMaxTorque.\\n\\nIf a cylindrical's Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to rotate to an angle specified by Class.CylindricalConstraint.TargetAngle|TargetAngle. This rotation is controlled by Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularSpeed|AngularSpeed, Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularResponsiveness|AngularResponsiveness, and Class.CylindricalConstraint.ServoMaxTorque|ServoMaxTorque.\\n\\nLinear power\\n\\nIf a cylindrical's Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to translate the attachments with the goal of reaching Class.CylindricalConstraint|Velocity. You can further control this translation through both Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxAcceleration and Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxForce.\\n\\nIf a cylindrical's Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set separation specified by Class.CylindricalConstraint|TargetPosition. This translation is controlled by Class.CylindricalConstraint|Speed, Class.CylindricalConstraint|LinearResponsiveness, and Class.CylindricalConstraint|ServoMaxForce.\\n\\nLimits\\n\\nYou can set limits to restrict both the sliding range and rotation of a cylindrical constraint.\\n\\nEnabling the Class.CylindricalConstraint|LimitsEnabled property exposes the Class.CylindricalConstraint|LowerLimit and Class.CylindricalConstraint|UpperLimit values, as well as Class.CylindricalConstraint|Restitution which defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach either limit.\\n\\nEnabling the Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularLimitsEnabled|AngularLimitsEnabled property exposes the Class.CylindricalConstraint.LowerAngle|LowerAngle and Class.CylindricalConstraint.UpperAngle|UpperAngle limits, as well as Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularRestitution|AngularRestitution which defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach either limit.\\n\\n\\n\\n    LimitsEnabled = true\\n\\n\\n\\n    AngularLimitsEnabled = true\\n\\n\\nInclination angle\\n\\nClass.CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle|InclinationAngle defines the direction of the rotation axis as an angle from the X axis in the X/Y plane of Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0, from -180 to 180. This lets you tilt the rotating element without changing the sliding axis.\\n\\n\\n\\n    InclinationAngle = 90\\n\\n\\n\\n    InclinationAngle = 30\",\n    \"source\": \"cylindrical.md\"\n}",
