It can be used to retrieve display-ready localized text from a\n  Class.LocalizationTable. The source of the Class.Translator.LocaleId\n  property, the set of tables it will search, and the order it will search them\n  in depends on which method was used to create the Translator instance.\n\n  The input for a Translator is the original development language string and a\n  context, where all or part of the context can be used to find a more\n  precise/situational translation for the source string.\n\n  The Translator can also be used to manufacture translated strings with inserts\n  (data replacements) which may change order based on the target language.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Translator.LocaleId\n    summary: |\n      The locale of translated strings.\n    description: |\n      The Roblox locale of the output translated strings from this table, for\n      example \"en-us\" or \"es-es.\" Defaults to \"en-us\".\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods:\n  - name: Translator:FormatByKey\n    summary: |\n      Returns the localized text string in a Class.LocalizationTable based on\n      its Class.Translator locale, by key.\n    description: |\n      Returns the localized text string in a Class.LocalizationTable based on\n      its Class.Translator locale, by key.

For example, the English noun \"Screen\"\n      can indicate both a computer screen and a window screen, but the Spanish\n      translations are completely different:\n\n\n\n\n            A\n            B\n            C\n            D\n            E\n\n\n            Key\n            Context\n            Source\n            Example\n            es\n\n\n\n\n            Screen\n\n            Pantalla\n\n\n\n\n            Screen\n\n            Mosquitero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      In these cases, the first argument to this function &mdash; a valid\n      in-game Class.Instance &mdash; can be used as a \"tie breaker\" when\n      multiple GUI objects use the same source string. To implement this,\n      specify the \"path\" to the Class.Instance you'd like to override as the\n      Context value of the translation data:\n\n\n\n\n            A\n            B\n            C\n            D\n            E\n\n\n            Key\n            Context\n            Source\n            Example\n            es\n\n\n\n            workspace.ComputerScreen.SurfaceGui.TextLabel\n            Screen\n\n            Pantalla\n\n\n\n\n            Screen\n\n            Mosquitero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Then, when calling this function in a script, pass the same\n      Class.Instance as the first argument, followed by the Source lookup\n      text as the second argument:\n\n      lua\n      local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n      local LocalizationService = game:GetService(\"LocalizationService\")\n\n      local success, translator = pcall(function()\n      \treturn LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForPlayerAsync(Players.LocalPlayer)\n      end)\n\n      if success then\n      \tlocal trans = translator:Translate(workspace.ComputerScreen.SurfaceGui.TextLabel, \"Screen\")\n      \tprint(trans)\n      else\n      \twarn(\"Cannot load translator for player!\")\n      end\n\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: context\n        type: Instance\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A valid in-game Class.Instance to use for context override as\n          outlined above. Note that this argument can be arbitrary, for example\n          game, if you don't require a context override.\n      - name: text\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Source text to look up and translate.\n    returns:\n      - type: string\n        summary: |\n          The translated text.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
