It typically has a child Handle with a\\n  child Attachment and a WrapLayer in the case of Layered Clothing.\\n\\n  The Accessory class is the successor to the legacy Hat system. It's\\n  cross-compatible with both the legacy R6 character system and the new R15\\n  character system.\\n\\n  If you insert an Class.Attachment into the Accessory's Handle with the same\\n  name as an Class.Attachment in one of the character's limbs, they connect\\n  and ignore properties inherited from the Class.Accoutrement class.\\n  Otherwise, the Accessory functions identically to a Class.Hat.\\n\\n  Note: If there are two matching Attachments, the resulting Class.Weld is a\\n  child of the Accessory's Handle. This differs from the legacy behavior of Hats\\n  where the Weld is always a child of the Head of the character.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Accoutrement\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: Accessory.AccessoryType\\n    summary: |\\n      Specifies the AccessoryType of the Accessory (eg.
