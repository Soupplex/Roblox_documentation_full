To create an EditableImage from\n  an existing image, use Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync().\n\n  EditableImage can be used in any Datatype.Content property which takes an\n  image, such as Class.ImageLabel.ImageContent or\n  Class.MeshPart.TextureContent. This is done by setting the content property\n  to Datatype.Content.fromObject(editableImage).\n\n  The EditableImage coordinate system is relative to the top left of the\n  image:\n\n  - Top-left: (0, 0)\n  - Bottom-right: (Size.X - 1, Size.Y - 1)\n\n  When you use Class.AssetService:PromptCreateAssetAsync() to publish an\n  object that has a Datatype.Content property which references an\n  EditableImage, the editable image is published as an image and the property\n  is set to a new asset ID.\n\n  #### Update Limitations\n\n  Only a single EditableImage can be updated per frame on the display side.\n  For example, if you update three EditableImage objects which are currently\n  being displayed, it will take three frames for all of them to be updated.\n\n  #### Enabling for Published Experiences\n\n  For security purposes, using EditableImage fails by default for published\n  experiences. To enable usage, you must be 13+ age verified and ID verified.\n  After you are verified, open Studio's\n  Experience Settings, select\n  Security, and enable the Allow Mesh &#47; Image APIs toggle.\n\n  #### Permissions\n\n  To prevent misuse, Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync() only allows\n  you to load and edit image assets:\n\n  - That are owned by the creator of the experience (if the experience is owned\n    by an individual).\n  - That are owned by a group (if the experience is owned by the group).\n  - That are owned by the logged in Studio user (if the place file has not yet\n    been saved or published to Roblox).\n\n  The APIs throw an error if they are used to load an asset that does not meet\n  the criteria above.\n\n  #### Memory Limits\n\n  Editable assets are currently expensive for memory usage. To minimize its\n  impact on client performance, EditableImage has strict client-side memory\n  budgets, although the server, Studio, and plugins operate with unlimited\n  memory. Linking one Class.EditableImage to multiple image-related\n  Datatype.Content data types (multi-referencing) can help with memory\n  optimization.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Object\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: EditableImage.Size\n    summary: |\n      Size of the EditableImage in pixels.\n    description: |\n      Size of the EditableImage in pixels.
