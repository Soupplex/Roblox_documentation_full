It consists of the following UI\n  elements:\n\n  - An overlay containing the experience name and Roblox branding. These remain\n    on screen when a screenshot is taken, although the experience name can be\n    disabled through the Class.ScreenshotHud.ExperienceNameOverlayEnabled\n    property.\n  - A camera button that hides all UI except for the overlay and takes a\n    screenshot.\n  - A close button that closes the Class.ScreenshotHud.\n\n\ncodesamples:\n  - ScreenshotHud\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  -
