For example, if Stop() is called with a fadeTime\\n      of 2, it will take two seconds for the weight of the track to reach zero\\n      and its effects completely end. Please note this will be the case\\n      regardless of the initial weight of the animation.\\n\\n      It is not recommended to use a fadeTime of 0 in an attempt to override\\n      this effect and end the animation immediately for Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds\\n      that have their Class.Motor.MaxVelocity set to zero, as this causes the\\n      joints to freeze in place. If it must end immediately, ensure the\\n      Class.Motor.MaxVelocity of Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds in your rig are high\\n      enough for them to snap properly.\\n    codesamples:\\n      - AnimationTrack-Stop\\n    parameters:\\n      - name: fadeTime\\n        type: float\\n        default: 0.100000001\\n        summary: |\\n          The time, in seconds, for which animation weight is to be faded out\\n          over.\\n    returns:\\n      - type: ()\\n        summary: ''\\n    tags:\\n      - CustomLuaState\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security: None\\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Animation\\nevents:\\n  - name: AnimationTrack.DidLoop\\n    summary: |\\n      Fires when an Class.AnimationTrack loops on the next update following\\n      the end of the previous animation loop.\\n    description: |\\n      This event fires whenever a looped Class.AnimationTrack completes a\\n      loop, on the next update.\\n\\n      Currently it may also fire at the exact end of a non looped animation\\n      track but this behavior should not be relied upon.\\n    codesamples:\\n      - AnimationTrack-DidLoop\\n    parameters: []\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security: None\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Animation\\n  - name: AnimationTrack.Ended\\n    summary: |\\n      Fires when the Class.AnimationTrack is completely done moving anything\\n      in the world.\\n    description: |\\n      Fires when the Class.AnimationTrack is completely done moving anything\\n      in the world, meaning the animation has finished playing, the \\\"fade out\\\"\\n      is finished, and the subject is in a neutral pose.\\n\\n      You can use this to take action when the animation track's subject is back\\n      in a neutral pose that's unaffected by the Class.AnimationTrack or to\\n      clean up the Class.AnimationTrack.\\n    codesamples:\\n      - AnimationTrack-Ended\\n    parameters: []\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security: None\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Animation\\n  - name: AnimationTrack.KeyframeReached\\n    summary: |\\n      Fires every time playback of an Class.AnimationTrack reaches a\\n      Class.Keyframe that does not have the default name of Keyframe.\\n    description: |\\n      Fires every time playback of an Class.AnimationTrack reaches a\\n      Class.Keyframe that does not have the default name of Keyframe.
