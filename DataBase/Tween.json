Creating\n  and configuring a Class.Tween is done with the Class.TweenService:Create()\n  function; Datatype.Instance.new() cannot be used for this particular object.\n\n  Note that while the configuration of a tween can be accessed after a tween has\n  been created, it can not be modified. If new goals are needed for an\n  interpolation, a new Class.Tween must be created.\n\n  Also note that multiple tweens can be played on the same object at the same\n  time, but they must not be interpolating the same property. If two tweens\n  attempt to modify the same property, the initial tween will be cancelled and\n  overwritten by the most recent tween.\ncodesamples:\n  - Tween-Creation\ninherits:\n  - TweenBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Tween.Instance\n    summary: |\n      Read-only property that points to the Class.Instance whose properties\n      are being interpolated by the tween.\n    description: |\n      This property of a Class.Tween (read-only) points to the\n      Class.Instance whose properties are being interpolated.\n    codesamples:\n      - Tween-Instance\n    type: Instance\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Tween.TweenInfo\n    summary: |\n      Read-only property that includes information on how the interpolation of\n      the Class.Tween is to be carried out.\n    description: |\n      Read-only property that includes information on how the interpolation of\n      the Class.Tween is to be carried out, using the Datatype.TweenInfo\n      data type.\n    codesamples:\n      - TweenInfo\n    type: TweenInfo\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
