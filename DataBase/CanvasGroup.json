GuiEffect (Class.UICorner and Class.UIGradient)\\n  under CanvasGroup will also apply to the whole group. CanvasGroup always has\\n  Class.GuiObject.ClipsDescendants set to true and all descendants will render\\n  within CanvasGroup's viewport.\\n\\n  ### Important notes:\\n\\n  - Descendants of CanvasGroup will be rendered as a flattened texture only when\\n    the ancestor Class.LayerCollector has its\\n    Class.LayerCollector.ZIndexBehavior set to Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Sibling.\\n  - CanvasGroup consumes extra texture memory. The quality of the texture and\\n    total memory usage is limited by the Enum.QualityLevel of the client. When\\n    exceeding the memory cap, CanvasGroup will render as a blank texture.\\n  - We recommend using CanvasGroup with static sizes, otherwise a new texture\\n    would need to be created to accommodate new sizes.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - GuiObject\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: CanvasGroup.GroupColor3\\n    summary: |\\n      Color tint that applies to all descendants.\\n    description: |\\n      Color tint that applies to all descendants.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: Color3\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Appearance\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - UI\\n  - name: CanvasGroup.GroupTransparency\\n    summary: |\\n      Transparency that applies to all descendants.\\n    description: |\\n      Transparency that applies to all descendants.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Appearance\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - UI\\nmethods: []\\nevents: []\\ncallbacks: []\",\n    \"source\": \"CanvasGroup.yaml\"\n}",
