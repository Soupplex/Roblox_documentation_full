However, unlike those two\\n  cases, it is orientated so that the height of the cylinder is along the\\n  Class.BasePart Y axis.\\n\\n  The dimensions of the mesh scale relative to the Class.BasePart.Size of the\\n  Class.BasePart. This scale is uniformly along the Class.BasePart Y axis\\n  and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the part's X and Z axis, using the lowest\\n  value. This means the Class.BasePart can be resized normally, but the cross\\n  section of the cylinder will always remain a circle and cannot be stretched or\\n  compressed.\\n\\n  Note as the CylinderMesh object does not include a texture the\\n  Class.DataModelMesh.VertexColor property does not do anything.\\n\\n  ## Why use a CylinderMesh?\\n\\n  The advantage of using a mesh over setting the Class.Part.Shape property of\\n  a part to 'Cylinder' is that the Class.DataModelMesh.Scale and\\n  Class.DataModelMesh.Offset properties are exposed. These allow the position\\n  and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing\\n  the Class.BasePart.Position or Class.BasePart.Size of the Class.Part the\\n  mesh is parented to.\\n\\n  The key difference between a CylinderMesh or a Class.SpecialMesh with\\n  Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType set to 'Cylinder' is the orientation of the\\n  cylinder mesh. With a CylinderMesh, the height of the cylinder is aligned with\\n  the height (Y axis) of the part. With a Class.SpecialMesh (or Class.Part\\n  with Class.Part.Shape set to 'Cylinder'), the height of the cylinder is\\n  aligned with the X axis.\\ncodesamples:\\n  - CylinderMesh-Instantiation\\ninherits:\\n  - BevelMesh\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This class is deprecated, and Class.CylinderMesh|CylinderMeshes are no\\n  longer supported.
