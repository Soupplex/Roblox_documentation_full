It's different from the Class.LuaSourceContainer open in the\n  editor in that it represents the ephemeral state of an open document, and its\n  representation is in a format that's more suited for reading and editing code\n  than executing it. In particular, Class.ScriptDocument reflects any changes\n  that have been made to the open script in Drafts Mode, which the source\n  property doesn't.\n\n  The Script Editor itself exists and changes on a different thread than any\n  Class.DataModel, so the Class.ScriptDocument replicates the open Script\n  Editor, but it isn't the open editor. Because of the replication, there's\n  sometimes a slight delay between changing the text in the editor and updating\n  the Class.ScriptDocument. The delay usually occurs because the\n  Class.DataModel is busy, and it's almost always extremely small, but it\n  still exists.\n\n  The existence of a Class.ScriptDocument indicates that a document is open in\n  the Script Editor. All Class.ScriptDocument instances have\n  Class.ScriptEditorService as its parent. Each instance adheres to the\n  following encoding conventions:\n\n  - All text in Class.ScriptDocument is UTF-8 encoded.\n  - All line indices are 1-indexed.\n  - All character indices are 1-indexed and count UTF-8 bytes, not graphemes, so\n    the same warning from Class.TextBox.CursorPosition applies: many Unicode\n    characters take more than one byte.\n  - All ranges are inclusive of their start position and exclusive of their end\n    position, so start == end implies an empty range.\n\n  All APIs for Class.ScriptDocument are at Plugin level security.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: ScriptDocument:CloseAsync\n    summary: |\n      Requests that the editor associated with this document close.

If the range is empty, then\n      the function inserts the text at (startLine, startColumn). If the text\n      cursor is within the specified range, the cursor moves to the end position\n      of the edit. Otherwise, the text cursor doesn't move. This function yields\n      the current thread until it receives a reply from the editor about the\n      edit.\n\n      If the function succeeds, it returns (true, nil).\n\n      The function throws an error if:\n\n      - The range is invalid.\n      - The range would slice a unicode character, for example replace only some\n        of the bytes of the unicode character.\n      - The newText itself contains invalid UTF-8.\n\n      If the function fails, it returns (false, string). The string is a\n      description of the problem. The most common failure type is a version\n      mismatch. This occurs when you try to call EditTextAsync during the time\n      when the Class.ScriptDocument is out of sync with the contents of the\n      editor. If this happens, you can retry the edit.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: newText\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: startLine\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: startCharacter\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: endLine\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: endCharacter\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: ScriptDocument:ForceSetSelectionAsync\n    summary: |\n      Asks the editor to set its cursor selection to the argument values.\n    description: |\n      Asks the editor to set its cursor selection to the argument values.
