It is currently based on a 4&times;4&times;4 grid of cells, where each\n  cell has a number between 0 and 1 representing how much the geometry should\n  occupy the cell, and the material of the cell. The occupancy determines how\n  the cell will morph together with surrounding cells, and the result is the\n  illusion of having no grid constraint.\n\n  For more information, see Terrain.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BasePart\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Terrain.Decoration\n    summary: |\n      Enables or disables terrain decoration.\n    description: |\n      Currently enables or disables animated grass on the Grass terrain\n      material, although future modifications of this property may control\n      additional decorative features.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - NotScriptable\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Terrain.GrassLength\n    summary: |\n      Specifies the length of animated grass.\n    description: |\n      Specifies the length of animated grass on the Grass terrain material,\n      assuming Class.Terrain.Decoration|Decoration is enabled.
