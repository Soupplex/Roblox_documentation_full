    "content": "For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mover constraints, including Class.LineForce, see mover constraints. Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\n\nThe Class.LineForce constraint applies force along the theoretical line connecting its two Class.Attachment|Attachments. As the end points (attachments) move, the direction of force will change accordingly.\n\nForce location\n\nBy default, force is applied to either parent at its attachment location. If desired, force can be focused at each parent's center of mass by toggling on Class.LineForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass.\n\n\n\n    ApplyAtCenterOfMass = false\n\n\n\n    ApplyAtCenterOfMass = true\n\n\nInverse square law\n\nWhen Class.LineForce.InverseSquareLaw|InverseSquareLaw is true, the force magnitude is multiplied by the inverse square of the distance, meaning the force will increase exponentially as the two attachments get closer together, like magnets. When using this setting, it's recommended that you set a Class.LineForce.MaxForce|MaxForce threshold to prevent infinite force if the attachments align precisely.\n\n\n\n    InverseSquareLaw = false\n\n\n\n    InverseSquareLaw = true\n\n\nReactionary force\n\nBy default, the constraint only applies force to Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0, while Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 remains unaffected. However, force can be applied to both attachments in equal and opposite directions by enabling Class.LineForce.ReactionForceEnabled|ReactionForceEnabled.\n\n\n\n    ReactionForceEnabled = false\n\n\n\n    ReactionForceEnabled = true",
