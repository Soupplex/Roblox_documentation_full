Scripts firing a Class.RemoteEvent do not yield.\ndescription: |\n  The RemoteEvent object facilitates asynchronous, one-way communication\n  across the client-server boundary\n  without yielding for a response. This communication can be directed from one\n  client to the server, from the server to a specific client, or from the server\n  to all clients.\n\n  In order for both the server and clients to access a Class.RemoteEvent\n  instance, it must be in a place where both sides can see it, such as\n  Class.ReplicatedStorage, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it\n  in Class.Workspace or inside a Class.Tool.\n\n  If no connected listener exists to handle an event, you might see a\n  Remote event invocation discarded error in the log to indicate that the\n  event was discarded and that you need to implement either OnClientEvent or\n  OnServerEvent. Unlike Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents,\n  Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents buffer a large number of events before\n  throwing this error.\n\n  If you need the result of the call, you should use a Class.RemoteFunction\n  instead. Otherwise a remote event is recommended since it will minimize\n  network traffic/latency and won't yield the script to wait for a response.\n\n  See Remote events and callbacks for\n  code samples and further details.\n\n  #### Throttling\n\n  Remote events are subject to rate limits when sent from the client to the\n  server with the Class.RemoteEvent:FireServer()|FireServer() method.\n  Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents and\n  Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents both have a limit of\n  approximately 500 requests per second, per client. This limit is shared\n  among all remote events of the same type. To avoid throttling and latency\n  issues, limit recurring remote events whenever possible.\n\n  #### Parameter limitations\n\n  Any type of Roblox object (Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, etc.) can be\n  passed as a parameter when a Class.RemoteEvent is fired, as well as Luau\n  types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should carefully\n  explore the\n  limitations.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BaseRemoteEvent\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: RemoteEvent:FireAllClients\n    summary: |\n      Fires the Class.RemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent event for each\n      connected client.\n    description: |\n      Fires the Class.RemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent event for each\n      connected client.
