In general, the subclasses of\n  BodyMover are:\n\n  - Class.BodyForce exerts a force relative to world coordinates.\n  - Class.BodyPosition exerts force to maintain a certain world position.\n  - Class.BodyVelocity exerts force to maintain a certain velocity.\n  - Class.BodyThrust exerts a force relative to object coordinates which\n    applies torque if positioned in a certain way.\n  - Class.BodyGyro exerts torque to maintain a certain orientation.\n  - Class.BodyAngularVelocity exerts torque to maintain a certain angular\n    velocity.\n  - Class.RocketPropulsion exerts both translational and rotational forces to\n    cause an assembly to track down another.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - BodyAngularVelocity\n  - BodyForce\n  - BodyGyro\n  - BodyPosition\n  - BodyThrust\n  - BodyVelocity\n  - RocketPropulsion\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  This class has been deprecated.
