If the magnitude of such a force is great enough, assemblies can\\n  begin to accelerate. The force is determined by the\\n  Class.BodyForce.Force|Force property, and is defined on the three world\\n  axes.\\n\\n  A BodyForce alone cannot apply a torque (it cannot cause the parent to\\n  rotate on its own). To apply a force at a specific point or apply forces\\n  relative to the orientation of the assembly, use a Class.BodyThrust instead.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
