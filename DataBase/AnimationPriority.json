When the track weight sum reaches or\\n  exceeds 1.0 for a joint, evaluation stops and no lower-priority tracks will be\\n  evaluated for that joint. Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks with the same\\n  priority that are playing concurrently will blend proportional to their track\\n  weights (normalized if the sum exceeds 1).\\n\\n  Higher priority animation will override lower priority ones per joint. The\\n  priority order is:\\n\\n  1. Action4\\n  2. Action3\\n  3. Action2\\n  4. Action\\n  5. Movement\\n  6. Idle\\n  7.
