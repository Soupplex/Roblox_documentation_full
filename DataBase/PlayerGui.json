If a\n  Class.ScreenGui is a descendant, then any Class.GuiObject inside of the\n  Class.ScreenGui will be drawn to the player's screen. Any\n  Class.LocalScript will also run if it is inserted into a Class.PlayerGui.\n\n  When a player first joins the experience, their Class.PlayerGui is\n  automatically inserted into their Class.Player object. When the player's\n  Class.Player.Character spawns for the first time, all of the contents of\n  Class.StarterGui are automatically copied into the player's\n  Class.PlayerGui. Note that if Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads is set to\n  false, the character will not spawn and Class.StarterGui contents will not\n  be copied until Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync() is called. If\n  Class.StarterGui.ResetPlayerGuiOnSpawn is set to true, then every time the\n  player's character respawns, all of the contents of that player's\n  Class.PlayerGui are cleared and replaced with the contents of\n  Class.StarterGui.\n\n  If you need to control a player's UI container during playtime, for example to\n  show/hide a specific Class.ScreenGui or any of its children, access it as\n  follows from a Class.LocalScript:\n\n  lua\n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n\n  local player = Players.LocalPlayer\n  local playerGui = player.PlayerGui\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BasePlayerGui\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - PlayerReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PlayerGui.CurrentScreenOrientation\n    summary: |\n      Describes the player's current screen orientation.\n    description: |\n      Describes the player's current screen orientation.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ScreenOrientation\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: PlayerGui.ScreenOrientation\n    summary: |\n      Sets the preferred screen orientation mode for this player, if on a mobile\n      device.\n    description: |\n      Sets the preferred screen orientation mode for this player, if on a mobile\n      device.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ScreenOrientation\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: PlayerGui.SelectionImageObject\n    summary: |\n      Overrides the default selection adornment used for gamepads.\n    description: |\n      Overrides the default selection adornment used for gamepads.
