If you wish to verify if a\n  player is in a group, use the Class.Player:IsInGroupAsync() method rather\n  than Class.GroupService:GetGroupsAsync().\n\n  The service has a number of useful applications, such as detecting if a player\n  is an ally or enemy upon joining the game, or prompting a player to join a\n  group using the Class.GroupService:PromptJoinAsync() method.\ncodesamples:\n  - Group-Ally-Enemy-Checker\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: GroupService:GetAlliesAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns a Class.StandardPages object including information on all of the\n      specified group's allies.\n    description: |\n      Returns a Class.StandardPages object including information on all of the\n      specified group's allies.\n\n      This pages does not include a list of group IDs but instead a list of\n      group information tables, mirroring the format of those returned by\n      Class.GroupService:GetGroupInfoAsync().
