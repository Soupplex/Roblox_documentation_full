Should an experience be\n  uploaded by a different creator, the asset data would not be accessible. See\n  the Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset() method for more details on\n  this security check. Note that you should not use this service for loading\n  API keys or other secrets. Use Class.HttpService:GetSecret() instead.\n\n  #### See Also\n\n  - Class.AssetService, which can provide information about assets you might\n    want to load using InsertService\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: InsertService.AllowClientInsertModels\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - NotScriptable\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: InsertService.AllowInsertFreeModels\n    summary: |\n      Indicates whether ''Free Models'' can be inserted into the game.\n    description: |\n      The AllowInsertFreeModels property toggles whether ''Free Models'' can be\n      inserted into the game, regardless of whether the place owner owns the\n      asset.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n      - NotBrowsable\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This item was never released.
