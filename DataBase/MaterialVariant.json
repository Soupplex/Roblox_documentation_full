MaterialVariant has properties that can define the appearance of a\n  material. Its name can be set in MaterialService to globally override a\n  built-in material, or set in the Class.BasePart.MaterialVariant property to\n  change certain Parts. MaterialVariant objects only work as descendants of\n  MaterialService.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: MaterialVariant.AlphaMode\n    summary: |\n      Determines how the alpha channel of the Class.MaterialVariant.ColorMap\n      is used.\n    description: |\n      This property determines how the alpha channel of the\n      Class.MaterialVariant.ColorMap is used.\n\n      When set to Enum.AlphaMode|Transparency and the\n      Class.MeshPart.Transparency is set to 0, opaque pixels in the\n      Class.MaterialVariant.ColorMap|ColorMap renders as completely opaque in\n      the 3D scene.
