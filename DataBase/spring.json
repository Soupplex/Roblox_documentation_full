    "content": "For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mechanical constraints, including Class.SpringConstraint, see Mechanical constraints. Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\n\nA Class.SpringConstraint applies a force on its attachments based on spring and damper behavior. You can customize a spring's damping and stiffness, as well as set minimum and maximum limits on the spring's length.\n\nFree length\n\nClass.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength defines the natural resting length of the spring. If the attachments are further apart than the free length, they are forced together; if the attachments are closer together than the free length, they are forced apart.\n\nDamping\n\nThe Class.SpringConstraint.Damping|Damping value controls how fast the spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to oscillate endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more quickly.\n\nStiffness\n\nClass.SpringConstraint.Stiffness|Stiffness sets the strength of the spring. Higher values create a spring that responds with more force when its attachments are closer together or further apart than Class.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength.\n\n\n\n    Stiffness = 25\n\n\n\n    Stiffness = 500\n\n\nLimits\n\nEnabling the Class.SpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled property exposes the Class.SpringConstraint.MinLength|MinLength and Class.SpringConstraint.MaxLength|MaxLength values for setting the minimum and maximum length of the spring. If the spring's attachments reach these limits, they stop moving apart from one another without restitution.",
