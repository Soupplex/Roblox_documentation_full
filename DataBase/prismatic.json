    "content": "For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mechanical constraints, including Class.PrismaticConstraint, see Mechanical constraints. Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\n\nA Class.PrismaticConstraint creates a rigid joint between two attachments, allowing them to slide along one axis but not rotate. The constraint can also be powered for mechanisms like sliding doors and elevator platforms.\n\nOrientation of a prismatic's attachments affects how it will move. To ensure movement occurs along the desired axis, each attachment's Class.Attachment.Axis|Axis, visualized by the yellow arrow, should point in the same direction.\n\nLinear power\n\nIf a prismatic's Class.PrismaticConstraint|ActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to translate the attachments with the goal of reaching Class.PrismaticConstraint|Velocity. You can further control this translation through both Class.PrismaticConstraint|MotorMaxAcceleration and Class.PrismaticConstraint|MotorMaxForce.\n\nIf a prismatic's Class.PrismaticConstraint|ActuatorType is set to Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set separation specified by Class.PrismaticConstraint|TargetPosition. This translation is controlled by Class.PrismaticConstraint|Speed, Class.PrismaticConstraint|LinearResponsiveness, and Class.PrismaticConstraint|ServoMaxForce.\n\n\n\n    ActuatorType = Motor\n\n\n\n    ActuatorType = Servo\n\n\nLimits\n\nYou can set limits to restrict the sliding range a prismatic. Enabling the Class.PrismaticConstraint|LimitsEnabled property exposes the Class.PrismaticConstraint|LowerLimit and Class.PrismaticConstraint|UpperLimit values, as well as Class.PrismaticConstraint|Restitution which defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach either limit.",
