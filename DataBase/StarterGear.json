Whenever the player's character spawns, all of the contents of that\n  player's StarterGear will get copied into the player's Class.Backpack.\ndescription: |\n  StarterGear is a container that is automatically inserted into each\n  Class.Player when the player joins the game. When a player spawns, the\n  contents of that player's StarterGear is copied into the player's\n  Class.Backpack. Additionally, when a player connects to a game that permits\n  gear, all of the appropriate gear Class.Tool objects that the player owns\n  are inserted into that player's StarterGear.\n\n  Unlike Class.StarterPack, StarterGear is not a service but rather a child of\n  each Class.Player object -- this means that its contents are player-specific\n  so that each player can have different Class.Tool|Tools within their\n  Class.StarterGear. It is not replicated to any client, including the owning\n  player.\n\n  ## Accessing StarterGear\n\n  Listening to the Class.Players.PlayerAdded event is useful for\n\n\n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n\n  local toolExamplePrefab = Instance.new(\"Tool\")\n  toolExamplePrefab.Name = \"Example Tool\"\n\n  -- Accessing StarterGear from Server Script\n  local function onPlayerAdded(player)\n  \t-- Wait for the StarterGear to be added\n  \tlocal starterGear = player:WaitForChild(\"StarterGear\")\n  \t-- Add a Tool to the StarterGear\n  \tlocal toolExample = toolExamplePrefab:Clone()\n  \ttoolExample.Parent = starterGear\n  end\n\n  Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)\n\n\n  ## Allowing Gear\n\n  Whether or not gear can be permitted is determined in a place's settings page\n  under 'Permissions'. On the permissions page gear can be disabled and enabled\n  by genre and type. To disable gear, ensure all the gear types are not\n  selected.\n\n  Individual gear can also be added to a game using the 'Add to game' feature in\n  the Roblox catalog. This option can be found on the page of any gear that is\n  on sale. When gear is added to a game in this manner it will appear under the\n  'Store' heading on the game's page. The owner of the game (group or user)\n  receives a commission when gear is sold in this manner.\n\n  ## Gameplay Considerations\n\n  Before adding any gear to a game, consider the implication of doing so. Gear\n  includes Class.Script|Scripts and allows the player to perform actions that\n  the developer may not have considered. For example, a navigational gear may\n  allow the player to access a part of the map the developer does not want to be\n  accessed. Weapons allow players with gear to damage other players, possibly\n  without the ability to retaliate. Always play-test games after adding gear to\n  them to make sure there are no abuse cases.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
