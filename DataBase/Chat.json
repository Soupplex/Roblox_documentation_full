Unless you are\n      replacing the default Luau Chat System with your own, you should not need\n      to call this function.

The first argument\n      determines the event (using the Enum.ChatCallbackType enum) to which the\n      second argument, the function, shall be bound. The default Luau chat\n      system uses Class.Chat:InvokeChatCallback()|InvokeChatCallback to invoke\n      registered functions. Attempting to register a server- or client- only\n      callback on a peer that isn't a server or client respectively will raise\n      an error. The following sections describe in what ways registered\n      functions will be used.\n\n      #### OnCreatingChatWindow\n\n      Client-only. Invoked before the client constructs the chat window. Must\n      return a table of settings to be merged into the information returned by\n      the ChatSettings module.\n\n      #### OnClientFormattingMessage\n\n      Client-only. Invoked before the client displays a message (whether it is a\n      player chat message, system message, or /me command). This function is\n      invoked with the message object and may (or may not) return a table to be\n      merged into message.ExtraData.\n\n      #### OnClientSendingMessage\n\n      Not invoked at this time.\n\n      #### OnServerReceivingMessage\n\n      Server-only. Invoked when the server receives a message from a speaker\n      (note that speakers may not necessarily be a Class.Player chatting).\n      This callback is called with the Message object. The function can make\n      changes to the Message object to change the manner in which the message is\n      processed. The Message object must be returned for this callback to do\n      anything. Setting this callback can allow the server to, for example:\n\n      - Set message.ShouldDeliver to false in order to cancel delivery of the\n        message to players (useful for implementing a chat exclusion list)\n      - Get/set the speaker's name color (message.ExtraData.NameColor, a\n        Color3) on a message-by-message basis\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: callbackType\n        type: ChatCallbackType\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The callback to which the function shall be registered (this\n          determines in what way the function is called).\n      - name: callbackFunction\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The function to call when the callback is invoked using\n          Chat:InvokeChatCallback.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\n  - name: Chat:SetBubbleChatSettings\n    summary: |\n      Customizes various settings of the in-game bubble chat.\n    description: |\n      This function customizes various settings of the in-game bubble chat.\n\n      Before using this, make sure that bubble chat is enabled by setting\n      Class.Chat.BubbleChatEnabled to true.\n\n      The settings argument is a table where the keys are the names of the\n      settings you want to edit and the values are what you want to change these\n      settings to. Note that you don't have to include all of them in the\n      settings argument, omitting some will result in them keeping their default\n      value.\n\n      This function is client-side only, attempting to call it on the server\n      will trigger an error.\n    codesamples:\n      - customize-visual-aspects\n      - restore-default-settings\n    parameters:\n      - name: settings\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A settings table.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\nevents:\n  - name: Chat.Chatted\n    summary: |\n      Fires when Class.Chat:Chat() is called.\n    description: |\n      Fires when Class.Chat:Chat() is called.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: part\n        type: Instance\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: message\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: color\n        type: ChatColor\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\ncallbacks: []",
