In most cases using a function is sufficient, but for more advanced\n  cases it's recommended you familiarize yourself with the Library.coroutine\n  library.\ntags: []\ncodesamples: []\nproperties: []\nfunctions:\n  - name: task.spawn\n    summary: |\n      Calls/resumes a function/coroutine immediately through the engine's\n      scheduler.\n    description: |\n      Accepts a function or a thread (as returned by\n      Library.coroutine.create()) and calls/resumes it immediately through the\n      engine's scheduler. Arguments after the first are sent to the\n      function/thread.\n\n      If the calling script is currently running in a serial execution phase,\n      then the spawned function or thread is resumed in the current serial\n      execution phase. If the calling script is currently running in a parallel\n      execution phase, then the spawned function or thread is resumed in the\n      current parallel execution phase.

If the calling script is currently running in a parallel execution\n      phase, then the deferred function or thread is resumed in a parallel\n      execution phase.

Arguments after the second are sent to the\n      function/thread.\n\n      This function differs from the deprecated global delay() function in\n      that no throttling occurs: on the very same\n      Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat step in which enough time has\n      passed, the function is guaranteed to be called/resumed. Providing a\n      duration of zero (0) will guarantee that the function is called on the\n      very next Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat.\n\n      You can calculate the actual time passed by calling Library.os.clock()\n      upon scheduling and in the scheduled function.\n\n      If the calling script is currently running in a serial execution phase,\n      then the delayed function or thread is resumed in a serial execution\n      phase.

This means the\n      thread resumes on the very next step, which is equivalent in behavior to\n      Class.RunService.Heartbeat:Wait()\n\n      Unlike the deprecated global wait(), this function does not throttle\n      and guarantees the resumption of the thread on the first Heartbeat that\n      occurs when it is due. This function also only returns the elapsed time\n      and nothing else.\n\n      If the calling script is currently running in a serial execution phase,\n      then the script is resumed in a serial execution phase.

For example:\n\n      lua\n      local thread = task.delay(5, function()\n      \tprint(\"Hello world!\")\n      end)\n\n      task.cancel(thread)\n\n\n      Note that threads may be in a state where it is impossible to cancel them.\n      For example, the currently executing thread and threads that have resumed\n      another coroutine may not be cancelled. If this is the case, an error will\n      be generated. However, code should not rely on specific thread states or\n      conditions causing Library.task.cancel() to fail. It is possible that\n      future updates will eliminate these constraints and allow threads in these\n      states to be successfully cancelled.\n    parameters:\n      - name: thread\n        type: thread\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The thread that will be cancelled.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    codesamples: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''",
