Class.FaceControls properties can only be set\n  between 0 and 1. Different combinations of the Class.FaceControls property\n  values create different facial expressions. Recording multiple facial\n  expressions over time creates facial animation.\n\n  ## What is an Animatable Head?\n\n  An animatable head is a Class.MeshPart that implements a facial rig and is\n  capable of playing facial animations and triggering facial expressions. A\n  Class.FaceControls object that is a child of a head Class.MeshPart can\n  change the facial expressions of the head.\n\n  A head consists of the following three components:\n\n  - Skinned MeshPart instance for the head geometry with an internal rig that\n    deforms this skinned MeshPart\n  - FaceControls instance that drives the internal rig when properties such as\n    FaceControls.JawDrop are changed.\n  - Cage Class.WrapTarget instance for tight fitting facial accessories\n\n  In a third-party modeling tool, such as Blender or Maya, an artist can create\n  a joint-driven facial rig, pose the joints to match each of the individual\n  FACS controls, and save as an FBX. When a head .FBX is imported in Studio, a\n  facs-to-joint mapping is created. This mapping deforms the mesh geometry when\n  FaceControls properties are changed. The mapping and the facial rig (including\n  Class.Bone instances) are not exposed to developers and can only be accessed\n  through the FaceControls instance. The Class.MeshPart for a Dynamic Head\n  looks and behaves the same as a regular Class.MeshPart except when a\n  FaceControls instance is a child of the MeshPart. Editing the properties of\n  the FaceControls deforms the MeshPart's geometry. These properties are\n  available to animate in the Animation Editor.\n\n  See Facial Animation for\n  more information on usage and creation of an animatable head.\n\n  ## Animatable Heads in the Marketplace\n\n  If you are publishing your head to the Marketplace, your head asset must\n  include a minimum subset of face controls. Roblox's publishing validation\n  rejects assets without the following required poses:\n\n  - EyesLookDown\n  - EyesLookLeft\n  - EyesLookRight\n  - EyesLookUp\n  - JawDrop\n  - LeftEyeClosed\n  - LeftLipCornerPuller\n  - LeftLipStretcher\n  - LeftLowerLipDepressor\n  - LeftUpperLipRaiser\n  - LipsTogether\n  - Pucker\n  - RightEyeClosed\n  - RightLipCornerPuller\n  - RightLipStretcher\n  - RightLowerLipDepressor\n  - RightUpperLipRaiser\n\n  See\n  FACS pose reference\n  for more information on usage and creation of an animatable head.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: FaceControls.ChinRaiser\n    summary: |\n      Raises the chin up; moves the lower lip upwards.\n    description: |\n      Raises the chin up; moves the lower lip upwards\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Mouth\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: FaceControls.ChinRaiserUpperLip\n    summary: |\n      Moves the upper lip when ChinRaiser is engaged and touching the upper lip.\n    description: |\n      Moves the upper lip when ChinRaiser is engaged and touching the upper lip\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Mouth\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: FaceControls.Corrugator\n    summary: |\n      Brings the left and right brows inward together.\n    description: |\n      Brings the left and right brows inward together\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Brows\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: FaceControls.EyesLookDown\n    summary: |\n      Moves gaze down.
