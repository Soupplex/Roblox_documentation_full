To enable usage of EditableMesh, you must be 13+ age verified\n  and ID verified. After you are verified, open Studio's\n  Experience Settings, select\n  Security, and enable the Allow Mesh & Image APIs\n  toggle. Remember to review the\n  Terms of Use\n  before enabling the toggle.\n\n  #### Permissions\n\n  To prevent misuse, Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync() will only\n  allow you to load and edit mesh assets:\n\n  - That are owned by the creator of the experience (if the experience is owned\n    by an individual).\n  - That are owned by a group (if the experience is owned by the group).\n  - That are owned by the logged in Studio user (if the place file has not yet\n    been saved or published to Roblox).\n\n  #### Memory Limits\n\n  Editable assets are currently expensive for memory usage. To minimize its\n  impact on client performance, EditableMesh has strict client-side memory\n  budgets, although the server, Studio, and plugins operate with unlimited\n  memory. Using Class.EditableMesh.FixedSize|FixedSize may help you stay\n  within the memory budget and, in some scenarios, linking one EditableMesh to\n  multiple Class.MeshPart|MeshParts (multi-referencing) can help with memory\n  optimization.\n\n  #### Creation and Display\n\n  An EditableMesh can be created from an existing Datatype.Content of a\n  Class.MeshPart or a mesh ID using\n  Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(), or a blank EditableMesh can\n  be created with Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMesh(). It can then be\n  displayed, modified, and its collision model updated. Not all of the steps are\n  necessary; for example, you might want to create an EditableMesh just to\n  raycast without ever displaying it.\n\n  lua\n  local AssetService = game:GetService(\"AssetService\")\n\n  -- Create empty EditableMesh\n  local editableMesh = AssetService:CreateEditableMesh()\n\n  -- Create EditableMesh from asset ID\n  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \teditableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSETID))\n  end)\n\n  -- Create EditableMesh from another EditableMesh\n  local editableMeshFromAnother = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \teditableMeshFromAnother = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromObject(OTHEREDITABLEMESH))\n  end)\n\n  -- Create EditableMesh from MeshPart\n  local editableMeshFromMeshPart = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \teditableMeshFromMeshPart = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(MESHPART.MeshContent)\n  end)\n\n\n  An EditableMesh is displayed when it's linked to a new Class.MeshPart,\n  through Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync(). You can create more\n  Class.MeshPart instances that reference the same EditableMesh\n  Datatype.Content, or link to an existing Class.MeshPart through\n  Class.MeshPart:ApplyMesh().\n\n  lua\n  local AssetService = game:GetService(\"AssetService\")\n  local Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\n  -- Create EditableMesh from asset ID\n  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \teditableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSETID))\n  end)\n\n  -- Create new MeshPart linked to the EditableMesh\n  local newMeshPart = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \tnewMeshPart = AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync(Content.fromObject(editableMeshFromAsset))\n  end)\n\n  -- Alternatively, link the new MeshPart created above to an existing MeshPart\n  local existingMeshPart = Workspace:FindFirstChild(\"EXISTINGMESHPART\")\n  existingMeshPart:ApplyMesh(newMeshPart)\n\n\n  To recalculate collision and fluid geometry after editing, you can again call\n  Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync() and Class.MeshPart:ApplyMesh() to\n  update an existing Class.MeshPart. It's generally recommended to do this at\n  the end of a conceptual edit, not after individual calls to methods that\n  manipulate geometry. Visual changes to the mesh will always be immediately\n  reflected by the engine, without the need to call\n  Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync().\n\n  #### Fixed-Size Meshes\n\n  When creating an EditableMesh from an existing mesh asset (via\n  Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync()), the resulting editable mesh\n  is fixed-size by default. Fixed-size meshes are more efficient in terms of\n  memory but you cannot change the number of vertices, faces, or attributes.\n  Only the values of vertex attributes and positions can be edited.\n\n  lua\n  local AssetService = game:GetService(\"AssetService\")\n\n  -- Create EditableMesh without fixed-size default\n  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil\n  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()\n  \teditableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSETID), {FixedSize = false})\n  end)\n\n\n  #### Stable Vertex/Face IDs\n\n  Many EditableMesh methods take vertex, normal, UV, color and\n  face IDs. These are represented as integers in Luau but they require some\n  special handling. The main difference is that IDs are stable and they remain\n  the same even if other parts of the mesh change. For example, if an\n  EditableMesh has five vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and you remove vertex 4,\n  the new vertices will be {1, 2, 3, 5}.\n\n  Note that the IDs are not guaranteed to be in order and there may be holes in\n  the numbering, so when iterating through vertices or faces, you should iterate\n  through the table returned by Class.EditableMesh:GetVertices()|GetVertices()\n  or Class.EditableMesh:GetFaces()|GetFaces().\n\n  #### Split Vertex Attributes\n\n  A vertex is a corner of a face, and topologically connects faces together.\n  Vertices can have several attributes: position, normal, UV coordinate, color,\n  and transparency.\n\n  Sometimes it's useful for all faces that touch a vertex to use the same\n  attribute values, but sometimes you'll want different faces to use different\n  attribute values on the same vertex. For example, on a smooth sphere, each\n  vertex will only have a single normal. In contrast, at the corner of a cube,\n  the vertex will have 3 different normals (one for each adjacent face). You can\n  also have seams in the UV coordinates or sharp changes in the vertex colors.\n\n  When creating faces, every vertex will by default have one of each attribute:\n  one normal, one UV coordinate, and one color/transparency. If you want to\n  create a seam, you should create new attributes and set them on the face. For\n  example, this code will create a sharp cube:\n\n  lua\n  local AssetService = game:GetService(\"AssetService\")\n\n  -- Given 4 vertex IDs, adds a new normal and 2 triangles, making a sharp quad\n  local function addSharpQuad(editableMesh, vid0, vid1, vid2, vid3)\n  \tlocal nid = editableMesh:AddNormal()  -- This creates a normal ID which is automatically computed\n\n  \tlocal fid1 = editableMesh:AddTriangle(vid0, vid1, vid2)\n  \teditableMesh:SetFaceNormals(fid1, {nid, nid, nid})\n\n  \tlocal fid2 = editableMesh:AddTriangle(vid0, vid2, vid3)\n  \teditableMesh:SetFaceNormals(fid2, {nid, nid, nid})\n  end\n\n  -- Makes a cube with creased edges between the 6 sides\n  local function makeSharpCube()\n  \tlocal editableMesh = AssetService:CreateEditableMesh()\n\n  \tlocal v1 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 0, 0))\n  \tlocal v2 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 0, 0))\n  \tlocal v3 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 1, 0))\n  \tlocal v4 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 1, 0))\n  \tlocal v5 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 0, 1))\n  \tlocal v6 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 0, 1))\n  \tlocal v7 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 1, 1))\n  \tlocal v8 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 1, 1))\n\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v5, v6, v8, v7)  -- Front\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v3, v4, v2)  -- Back\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v5, v7, v3)  -- Left\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v2, v4, v8, v6)  -- Right\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v2, v6, v5)  -- Bottom\n  \taddSharpQuad(editableMesh, v3, v7, v8, v4)  -- Top\n\n  \teditableMesh:RemoveUnused()\n  \treturn editableMesh\n  end\n\n\n  #### Winding\n\n  Mesh faces have a front side and a back side. When drawing meshes, only the\n  front of the faces are drawn by default, although you can change this by\n  setting the mesh' Class.MeshPart.DoubleSided|DoubleSided property to true.\n\n  The order of the vertices around the face determines whether you are looking\n  at the front or the back. The front of the face is visible when the vertices\n  go counterclockwise around it.\n\n\n\n  #### FACS Poses\n\n  Animatable heads use the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). See the\n  FACS poses reference\n  for helpful information when using\n  Class.EditableMesh:GetFacsPoses()|GetFacsPoses() and similar methods.\n\n  Each FACS pose is specified by an Enum.FacsActionUnit value. For the FACS\n  pose, virtual bones can each have a Datatype.CFrame that transforms the\n  bones' initial Datatype.CFrame in the bind pose of the mesh into the\n  Datatype.CFrame for that FACS action unit's pose. All bone\n  Datatype.CFrame|CFrames are in the mesh's local space.\n\n  These FACS poses are blended together during animation. Sometimes, the\n  blending of the base poses produces poor results. In those cases, you can\n  override the blending of specific combinations of base poses with a\n  corrective pose\n  that is more pleasing. A corrective pose is specified by 2 or 3\n  Enum.FacsActionUnit values. Like a base FACS pose, for a corrective pose,\n  virtual bones can each have a Datatype.CFrame that transforms the bones'\n  initial Datatype.CFrame in the bind pose of the mesh into the\n  Datatype.CFrame for that FACS corrective.\n\n  Please note that corrective poses that operate on both left and right action\n  units are not currently expressible. For example, using LeftCheekPuff and\n  RightEyeClosed together in a corrective pose is not currently possible.\n\n  #### Limitations\n\n  EditableMesh currently has a limit of 60,000 vertices and 20,000 triangles.\n  Attempting to add too many vertices or triangles will cause an error.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Object\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: EditableMesh.FixedSize\n    summary: |\n      Returns true if a mesh is fixed-size.\n    description: |\n      Fixed-sized meshes allow changing the values of vertex attributes but do\n      not allow vertices and triangles to be added or deleted.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: RobloxEngineSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - DynamicGeneration\n  - name: EditableMesh.SkinningEnabled\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - DynamicGeneration\nmethods:\n  - name: EditableMesh:AddBone\n    summary: |\n      Adds a new bone and returns a stable bone ID.\n    description: |\n      Adds a new bone and returns a stable bone ID.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: boneProperties\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Options table containing bone parameters:\n\n          - Name — A string that specifies the bone name.
