It has been heavily sandboxed from the\n  standard Lua Library.os library and does not allow you to perform any\n  system-altering operations.\ntags: []\ncodesamples: []\nproperties: []\nfunctions:\n  - name: os.clock\n    summary: |\n      Returns elapsed time in seconds since an arbitrary baseline with\n      sub-microsecond precision.\n    description: |\n      Returns elapsed time in seconds since an arbitrary baseline with\n      sub-microsecond precision. This function is useful for comparing durations\n      between two events that occur on the same computer, and is the best option\n      for benchmarking.\n\n      Unlike with functions such as Library.os.time() or\n      Datatype.DateTime.now(), adjustments to the system clock (such as by the\n      user or NTP) do not\n      cause time to jump forwards or backwards.\n\n      lua\n      -- Record the initial time:\n      local startTime = os.clock()\n      -- Do something you want to measure the performance of:\n      local a, b = 0, 1\n      for  = 1, 5000000 do\n          a, b = b, a\n      end\n      -- Measure amount of time this took:\n      local deltaTime = os.clock() - startTime\n      print(\"Elapsed time: \" .. deltaTime)\n      -->  Elapsed time: 0.044425600033719 (actual number may vary)\n\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: double\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    codesamples: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: os.date\n    summary: |\n      Formats the given string with date/time information based on the given\n      time.\n    description: |\n      Formats the given formatString with date/time information based on the\n      given time, or if not provided, the value returned by Library.os.time().\n\n      This function should be avoided in new work.

If provided a table formatted similarly\n      to that returned by Library.os.date(), it returns the number of seconds\n      from the Unix epoch to that time instead.\n\n      Note that the returned time uses the device's local clock. Most operating\n      systems automatically sync their local time against online time servers,\n      so this should be within a few hundred milliseconds. However, users can\n      easily disable sync behavior and set the system time to anything they\n      want; for synchronized time between client and server, use\n      Class.Workspace:GetServerTimeNow() instead.\n\n      This function should be avoided in new work. Instead, use the\n      Datatype.DateTime API, which supports localized formatting.\n\n      When you need to precisely measure the time elapsed between two points in\n      time, like when testing performance, use Library.os.clock() instead.\n    parameters:\n      - name: time\n        type: table\n        default: UTC time\n        summary: |\n          A dictionary table describing a specific time, similar to that\n          returned by Library.os.date().
