This class also defines several properties for\n  interactive behavior, namely Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor|AutoButtonColor\n  and Class.GuiButton.Modal|Modal.\n\n  The most important event of a Class.GuiButton is\n  Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated, a multi-platform event that fires\n  when the button is activated. When using a mouse, this means clicking the\n  button and releasing with the cursor still over the UI object. For touch, the\n  same applies but with a touch instead of button press. Finally, for gamepads,\n  Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated fires if a Class.GuiButton is selected\n  when the A button is pressed and released. In short, this event is very\n  useful for multi-platform user interface programming as it provides a nice\n  general interface for a single user input.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiObject\ndescendants:\n  - ImageButton\n  - TextButton\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotBrowsable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: GuiButton.AutoButtonColor\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the button automatically changes color when the mouse\n      hovers over or clicks on it.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the button automatically changes color\n      when the user's Class.Mouse hovers over or clicks on it.
