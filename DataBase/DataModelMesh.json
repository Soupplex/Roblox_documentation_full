Note, they only\n  alter the appearance of the part and not the physics/collision boundaries of\n  the part. Developers looking to apply a mesh to a part that alters the part's\n  collision should use Class.MeshPart|MeshParts.\n\n  Note the Class.MeshPart and Class.CharacterMesh classes do not descend\n  from DataModelMesh.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - BevelMesh\n  - FileMesh\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotBrowsable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: DataModelMesh.Offset\n    summary: |\n      The Offset of a mesh determines the relative position from the\n      Class.BasePart.Position of a Class.BasePart that the mesh will be\n      displayed at.\n    description: |\n      The Offset of a mesh determines the distance from the\n      Class.BasePart.Position of a Class.BasePart that the mesh will be\n      displayed.\n\n      #### How to use mesh offset\n\n      The Offset property changes the relative position the mesh will be\n      rendered at. For example, an offset of 0, 5, 0 will cause the mesh to be\n      displayed 5 studs above the position of the Class.BasePart.\n\n      The position of the Class.BasePart remains unchanged, meaning the\n      physics collision box of the part will remain in the same location. This\n      is demonstrated in the image below where the green outline (a\n      Class.SelectionBox) shows the extents of the Class.BasePart.\n\n      #### Other uses for mesh offset\n\n      There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.\n\n      - Offset and Class.DataModelMesh.Scale can be animated using\n        Class.TweenService relatively inexpensively as the engine does not\n        need to make any physics/collision calculations as the Class.BasePart\n        is not moved.\n      - Changing the relationship between the mesh and its collision extents\n        (determined by the Class.BasePart)\n    codesamples:\n      - Mesh-Offset-and-Scale\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: DataModelMesh.Scale\n    summary: |\n      The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its\n      original dimensions.\n    description: |\n      The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its\n      original dimensions.\n\n      #### How to use mesh scale\n\n      The scale property works slightly differently depending on the type of\n      mesh being used. Note the size of the Class.BasePart remains unchanged,\n      meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain the same.\n\n      - Class.SpecialMesh objects with Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to\n        'FileMesh' scale relative to the original dimensions of the mesh when it\n        was uploaded to Roblox\n      - Class.BlockMesh objects or Class.SpecialMesh objects with\n        Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to 'Brick', 'Wedge' or 'Sphere' scale\n        uniformly relative to the Class.BasePart.Size of their parent\n      - Class.CylinderMesh objects or Class.SpecialMesh objects with\n        Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to 'Cylinder' scale relative to the\n        Class.BasePart.Size of their parent. Uniformly for the cylinders\n        height axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the length and width of the\n        cylinder, using the lowest value.\n      - Class.SpecialMesh objects with Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to\n        'Head' currently scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not\n        rely on this as there are plans to change this behavior.\n      - Class.SpecialMesh objects with Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to\n        'Torso' scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on\n        this as there are plans to deprecate this mesh type.\n\n      #### Mesh scale demonstration\n\n      The above behavior can be seen in the following demonstration images.\n\n      Linear scaling relative to part size for 'Brick', 'Wedge' and 'Sphere'\n      meshes.\n\n      Linear scaling relative to original uploaded mesh for 'FileMesh' meshes\n\n      Non-uniform constrained scaling for 'Cylinder' meshes\n\n      #### Other uses for mesh scale\n\n      There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.\n\n      - Class.DataModelMesh.Offset and Scale can be animated using\n        Class.TweenService relatively inexpensively as the engine does not\n        need to make any physics/collision calculations as the Class.BasePart\n        is not changed.\n      - Changing the relationship between the mesh and its collision extents\n        (determined by the Class.BasePart)\n    codesamples:\n      - Mesh-Offset-and-Scale\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: DataModelMesh.VertexColor\n    summary: |\n      Changes the hue of a mesh's texture, used with Class.FileMesh.TextureId.\n    description: |\n      VertexColor determines the hue change of the\n      Class.FileMesh.TextureId|Texture of a Class.FileMesh. Note that this\n      property is a Datatype.Vector3 rather than a Datatype.Color3; to\n      convert, use the Datatype.Color3.R, Datatype.Color3.G, and\n      Datatype.Color3.B properties.\n\n      Although this property allows basic modification of a texture, changing a\n      texture entirely provides more control.
