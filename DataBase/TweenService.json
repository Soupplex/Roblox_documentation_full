Class.Tween|Tweens can be used on any\n  object with compatible property types, including:\n\n  - number\n  - boolean\n  - Datatype.CFrame\n  - Datatype.Rect\n  - Datatype.Color3\n  - Datatype.UDim\n  - Datatype.UDim2\n  - Datatype.Vector2\n  - Datatype.Vector2int16\n  - Datatype.Vector3\n  - Datatype.EnumItem\n\n  Class.TweenService:Create(), the primary constructor function, takes\n  Datatype.TweenInfo specifications about the tween and generates the\n  Class.Tween object which can then be used to play the tween.\n\n  Note that Class.Tween|Tweens can interpolate multiple properties at the same\n  time, but they must not be interpolating the same property. If two tweens\n  attempt to modify the same property, the initial tween will be cancelled and\n  overwritten by the most recent tween.\ncodesamples:\n  - Tween-Creation\n  - Looped-Tween\n  - Tween-Pausing\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: TweenService:Create\n    summary: |\n      Creates a new Class.Tween given the object whose properties are to be\n      tweened, a Datatype.TweenInfo, and a dictionary of goal property values.\n    description: |\n      This constructor creates a new Class.Tween from three arguments: the\n      object to tween, the Datatype.TweenInfo specifications, and a table\n      containing the properties to tween and values to tween to.\n\n      The propertyTable parameter needs to be a dictionary where the keys are\n      the string names of the property (for example Position, Transparency,\n      or Color), and the values are the property targets at the end of the\n      tween.\n\n      The Class.Tween created using this function is unique to the object\n      given as the instance parameter.
