This effect can be applied to either an\n  individual sound or to a sound group by parenting it to the desired instance.\n\n  The effect is controlled by several properties. First, the Delay is how long\n  the effect will wait to play the echoed sound. Feedback determines how much\n  the original signal is diminished to play as the echoed sound. Note that this\n  echoed sound also goes through the echo effect which will wait another delay\n  and play another echo. This process will repeat until the volume of the echoed\n  sound is negligible.\n\n  You can also adjust the wet/dry mix of the effect. The dry component of the\n  sound is the original sound that the effect is being applied to. You can\n  adjust the volume of the dry sound by adjusting the DryLevel. The wet sound is\n  the echoed effect itself, and its volume can be adjusted with WetLevel.\n\n  It is recommended to only use the EchoSoundEffect with sound groups. If an\n  echo effect is applied to a regular Sound, once that sound stops playing the\n  echo effect will also be cut off. When applied to a SoundGroup, the echo\n  effect will continue playing even if the original source sound has\n  stopped.Like all other Class.SoundEffect, a EchoSoundEffect can be applied\n  either to a Class.Sound or Class.SoundGroup by being parented to either.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SoundEffect\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: EchoSoundEffect.Delay\n    summary: |\n      The amount of time between echoes.\n    description: |\n      Range: 0.01 to 5 (default 1) The amount of time between echoes. Measured\n      in seconds.\n\n      If a EchoSoundEffect is applied to a singular sound instead of a sound\n      group, if the sound stops playing before the delay causes an echo, the\n      echo will not play. Because of this, it is recommended to apply echo\n      effects to SoundGroups and not Sounds.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - LegacySound\n  - name: EchoSoundEffect.DryLevel\n    summary: |\n      The output volume of the original sound.\n    description: |\n      Range: -80 to 10 (default 0) The output volume of the original sound.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - LegacySound\n  - name: EchoSoundEffect.Feedback\n    summary: |\n      The echo decay every time the echo plays.\n    description: |\n      Range: 0 to 1 (default 0.5) The echo decay every time the echo plays.\n      Setting this at it's minimum (0) will cause no feedback, meaning the echo\n      won't be audible at all.
