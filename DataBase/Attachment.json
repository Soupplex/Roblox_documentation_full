The offset is\\n  stored in the Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame property. The offset can also\\n  be set through other properties, such as\\n  Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame.\\n\\n  If no ancestral Class.PVInstance or Class.Attachment exists, then\\n  Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame and\\n  Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame are the same.\\n\\n  Attachments are used by several kinds of Class.Constraint|Constraints and\\n  are also valid alternatives to Class.BasePart as a parent for objects such\\n  as:\\n\\n  - Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters which will emit particles from the\\n    attachment's specific position/orientation instead of the Class.BasePart\\n    bounds.\\n\\n  - Light-emitting objects like Class.PointLight and Class.SpotLight which\\n    will shine from the attachment's position/orientation instead of the\\n    Class.BasePart center.\\n\\n  - Class.AudioEmitter which will use the attachment's position as the audio's\\n    point of emission.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants:\\n  - Bone\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: Attachment.Axis\\n    summary: |\\n      Direction of the X axis of the attachment, represented as a unit\\n      Datatype.Vector3.\\n    description: |\\n      Direction of the X axis of the attachment, represented as a unit\\n      Datatype.Vector3.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: Vector3\\n    tags:\\n      - NotReplicated\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Derived Data\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: false\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Basic\\n  - name: Attachment.CFrame\\n    summary: |\\n      Datatype.CFrame offset of the attachment.\\n    description: |\\n      The Datatype.CFrame offset of the attachment.
