    "content": "Class.ProximityPrompt objects\nencourage user interaction to trigger an action when they approach in-experience\nobjects such as doors, light switches, and buttons. Using this object, you can:\n\n- Indicate what objects a user can interact with in the experience.\n- Display the action a user can take on the object, then trigger the action through user input such as pressing or holding a key.\n- Display the correct input for all input types, such a keyboard, gamepad, and touchscreen keys.\n\nSee the Dungeon Delve sample place for the fully working proximity prompt examples shown in the video above.\n\nCreate proximity prompts\n\nYou must parent proximity prompts to the part, model, or attachment that you want a user to interact with. To add a proximity prompt to a Class.BasePart, Class.Model, or Class.Attachment object:\n\n1. In the Explorer window, hover over the Class.BasePart, Class.Model, or Class.Attachment and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\n1. From the menu, insert a ProximityPrompt.\n\n\n\nCustomize proximity prompts\n\nYou can customize a proximity prompt based on how you want it to appear, when you want it to be visible, and what you want a user to do to trigger the action.\n\nAppearance\n\nProximity prompts need to communicate three things:\n\n- The object that a user can interact with.\n- The action that triggers when they interact with the proximity\n  prompt.\n- The key that a user must press or hold.\n\nYou can specify these through the following properties:\n\n- Class.ProximityPrompt.ObjectText|ObjectText An optional name for the object a user can interact with.\n- Class.ProximityPrompt.ActionText|ActionText An optional name for the action a user will trigger.\n- Class.ProximityPrompt.KeyboardKeyCode|KeyboardKeyCode The keyboard key a user must press or hold to trigger the action.\n- Class.ProximityPrompt.GamepadKeyCode|GamepadKeyCode The gamepad key a user must press or hold to trigger the action.\n\n\n\nVisibility\n\nYou can control when the proximity prompt is visible through its Class.ProximityPrompt.MaxActivationDistance|MaxActivationDistance, Class.ProximityPrompt.RequiresLineOfSight|RequiresLineOfSight, and Class.ProximityPrompt.Exclusivity|Exclusivity properties.\n\nMaxActivationDistance\n\nThe Class.ProximityPrompt.MaxActivationDistance|MaxActivationDistance property allows you to define the range from around the Class.ProximityPrompt object that activates the visibility of the proximity prompt. Once a user's character enters that range, the proximity prompt becomes visible.\n\nRequiresLineOfSight\n\nThe Class.ProximityPrompt.RequiresLineOfSight|RequiresLineOfSight property activates the visibility of the proximity prompt when there's a clear path from the camera to the Class.ProximityPrompt object. By default, this property is set to true.\n\nExclusivity\n\nIf a user's character is within range of multiple proximity prompts, each proximity prompt's visibility depends on which proximity prompt the camera is pointing at, as well as each proximity prompt's Class.ProximityPrompt|Exclusivity property value.\n\nOnly one proximity prompt is visible per input keycode. If multiple in-range proximity prompts use different keycodes, they are all visible. However, if multiple in-range proximity prompts use the same keycode, only one proximity prompt is visible at any given time, depending on the camera's view direction.\n\nIf multiple proximity prompts are set to this exclusivity, only one prompt is visible at any given time, regardless of the character's proximity or the prompt's keycode. The camera's view direction determines which proximity prompt is visible, useful for minimizing prompt distraction when there are several in an area.\n\nProximity prompts are always visible when in range, assuming no other factors prevent them from being visible. Be cautious when using this setup, as all visible prompts using the same keycode will trigger on a player's input of that keycode.\n\nInteractivity\n\nYou can customize how a user interacts with a proximity prompt through its Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration|HoldDuration and Class.ProximityPrompt.ClickablePrompt|ClickablePrompt properties.\n\nHoldDuration\n\nThe Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration|HoldDuration property determines how many seconds a user has to press a key before the proximity prompt's action triggers. If this property has a value of 0, the proximity prompt's action triggers immediately.\n\nClickablePrompt\n\nThe Class.ProximityPrompt.ClickablePrompt|ClickablePrompt property specifies if a user can click on a proximity prompt to trigger its action. When set to true, a user can interact with the proximity prompt by directly clicking the proximity prompt or by pressing the specified key. When set to false, a user can only interact with the proximity prompt by pressing the specified key.\n\n  Note that if a user is using a phone or a tablet, they can always interact with the proximity prompt by directly clicking the proximity prompt regardless of the Class.ProximityPrompt.ClickablePrompt|ClickablePrompt property's value.\n\nScript proximity prompts\n\nYou can connect to proximity prompt events either on the Class.ProximityPrompt object itself or globally through Class.ProximityPromptService. The Class.ProximityPromptService allows you to manage all proximity prompt behavior from one location, preventing any need for duplicate code in your experience.\n\n\n    Event\n    Description\n\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptTriggered|PromptTriggered\n    Fires when a player interacts with a proximity prompt (after the duration for a prompt with non-zero Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration|HoldDuration).\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptTriggerEnded|PromptTriggerEnded\n    Triggers when the player stops interacting with a proximity prompt.\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptButtonHoldBegan|PromptButtonHoldBegan\n    Fires when a player begins interacting with a proximity prompt with a non-zero Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration|HoldDuration value.\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptButtonHoldEnded|PromptButtonHoldEnded\n    Fires when a player stops interacting with a proximity prompt with a non-zero Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration|HoldDuration value.\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptShown|PromptShown\n    Triggers in Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts when a proximity prompt is made visible.\n\n\n    Class.ProximityPromptService.PromptHidden|PromptHidden\n    Triggers in Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts when a prompt is hidden.\n\n\nThe following code sample includes a basic framework for using Class.ProximityPromptService:\n\nlua\nlocal ProximityPromptService = game:GetService(\"ProximityPromptService\")\n\n-- Detect when prompt is triggered\nlocal function onPromptTriggered(promptObject, player)\n\nend\n\n-- Detect when prompt hold begins\nlocal function onPromptHoldBegan(promptObject, player)\n\nend\n\n-- Detect when prompt hold ends\nlocal function onPromptHoldEnded(promptObject, player)\n\nend\n\n-- Connect prompt events to handling functions\nProximityPromptService.PromptTriggered:Connect(onPromptTriggered)\nProximityPromptService.PromptButtonHoldBegan:Connect(onPromptHoldBegan)\nProximityPromptService.PromptButtonHoldEnded:Connect(onPromptHoldEnded)",
