While in this mode, the default behavior is:\n\n  - Players can right-click and drag (mouse), tap and drag (mobile), use the\n    secondary thumbstick (gamepad), or press the left/right arrows (keyboard) to\n    rotate the camera around their character.\n  - When a player moves their character, it faces in the corresponding movement\n    direction.\n  - Players can zoom in and out freely, even to first person on full zoom in.\n\n  #### First Person\n\n  In first person mode (Enum.CameraMode|LockFirstPerson), the player's camera\n  is zoomed all the way in. Unless there is a visible GUI present with the\n  Class.GuiButton.Modal property set to true, moving the mouse, tap-dragging\n  on mobile, or using the secondary thumbstick on a gamepad will rotate the\n  camera around the character.\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nitems:\n  - name: Classic\n    summary: |\n      Third person camera which can be zoomed into first person.\n    value: 0\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: LockFirstPerson\n    summary: |\n      Exclusively first person camera.\n    value: 1\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''",
