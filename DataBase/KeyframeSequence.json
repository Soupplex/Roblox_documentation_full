The last\n  Class.Keyframe in the sequence, meaning the Class.Keyframe with the\n  highest Class.Keyframe.Time|Time property, determines the length of an\n  animation.\n\n  Although Class.KeyframeSequence.Priority|Priority and\n  Class.KeyframeSequence.Loop|Loop save the priority and looped animation\n  settings for the sequence, note that Class.AnimationTrack properties can\n  eventually overwrite these properties at playback time.\n\n  If you want to preview an Class.Animation before uploading it to Roblox, you\n  can generate a temporary hash ID using\n  Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterKeyframeSequence() for localized\n  animation testing.\n\n  #### Obtaining Sequences\n\n  In some cases you may wish to download the Class.KeyframeSequence\n  corresponding to an existing uploaded Class.Animation. You can use\n  Class.AnimationClipProvider:GetAnimationClipAsync() to download an\n  animation.\ncodesamples:\n  - Get-KeyframeSequence-Length\n  - KeyframeSequence-Instantiation\ninherits:\n  - AnimationClip\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: KeyframeSequence.AuthoredHipHeight\n    summary: |\n      Contains the hip height of the Class.Humanoid of the model that was used\n      to author this Class.KeyframeSequence.\n    description: |\n      Contains the hip height of the Class.Humanoid of the model that was used\n      to author this Class.KeyframeSequence.
