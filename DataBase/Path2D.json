It can be placed under\n  any Class.GuiObject and be edited directly in the viewport using built‑in\n  tooling. Path2D stores control points and exposes methods to sample\n  positions along the curve, enabling curved UI layouts, path‑based animations,\n  and interactive tools like graph editors and visual effects.\n\n  See the 2D paths guide for more information and\n  usage examples.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Path2D.Closed\n    summary: |\n      Connects the first and last control points when enabled.\n    description: |\n      Connects the first and last control points when enabled.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: Path2D.Color3\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color of the Class.Path2D.\n    description: |\n      Determines the color of the Class.Path2D.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Color3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: Path2D.SelectedControlPoint\n    summary: |\n      Index of the currently selected Datatype.Path2DControlPoint.\n    description: |\n      Index of the currently selected Datatype.Path2DControlPoint.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: int\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxScriptSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Control Points\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: Path2D.SelectedControlPointData\n    summary: |\n      Datatype.Path2DControlPoint data type representing the currently\n      selected control point.\n    description: |\n      Datatype.Path2DControlPoint data type representing the currently\n      selected control point, if any.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Path2DControlPoint\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxScriptSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Control Points\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: Path2D.Thickness\n    summary: |\n      Determines how thick the Class.Path2D path is.\n    description: |\n      Determines how thick the Class.Path2D path is.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: Path2D.Visible\n    summary: |\n      Determines if the Class.Path2D path is rendered or not.\n    description: |\n      Determines if the Class.Path2D path is rendered or not.
