These value\n  objects should be read by the Class.Script or Class.LocalScript associated\n  with the configuration to determine constants such as damage, speed or color.\n\n  For example,\n\n\n  local damage = 10\n\n\n  Becomes:\n\n\n  local configuration = tool:FindFirstChildWhichIsA(\"Configuration\", true)\n  damage = configuration:FindFirstChild(\"Damage\").Value -- A NumberValue\n\n\n  The Configuration object is intended to be placed inside a Class.BasePart in\n  a Class.Model or Class.Tool. It was originally intended to be used with a\n  tool that provided a GUI interface to edit these properties. However it is\n  more common now for developers to edit these values directly in the Roblox\n  Studio properties window.\n\n  ## Why should I use the Configuration object?\n\n  Use of Configurations is optional, but a number of developers chose to use\n  them for the following reasons.\n\n  - Variables held in a Configuration can be found quickly and are in a single\n    place\n  - When sharing your work, others can make changes without needing to modify\n    your code\n  - Provides a single location for variables read by multiple scripts in more\n    complex games\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
