If the\n  negated part is then unioned with a normal part using the Union tool,\n  sections where the negated part overlaps the normal part will be cut out.\n\n  Note that you can undo part negation by selecting the negated part and\n  clicking Negate again.\n\n  See Solid Modeling to learn more about\n  Studio's solid modeling tools and methods.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - PartOperation\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
