Also provides a range of\n  functions for interacting with the Class.CoreGui.\ndescription: |\n  Class.StarterGui is a container object designed to hold\n  Class.LayerCollector objects such as Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis.\n\n  When a Class.Player.Character spawns, the contents of their\n  Class.PlayerGui (if any) are emptied. Children of the Class.StarterGui are\n  then copied along with their descendants into the Class.PlayerGui. Note,\n  however, that Class.LayerCollector objects such as\n  Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis with their\n  Class.LayerCollector.ResetOnSpawn|ResetOnSpawn property set to false will\n  only be placed into each player's Class.PlayerGui once and will not be\n  deleted when the Class.Player respawns.\n\n  Class.StarterGui also includes a range of functions allowing you to interact\n  with the Class.CoreGui. For example Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled()\n  can be used to disable elements of the Class.CoreGui, and\n  Class.StarterGui:SetCore() can perform a range of functions including\n  creating notifications and system messages.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BasePlayerGui\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: StarterGui.ProcessUserInput\n    summary: |\n      Allows this service to process input like Class.PlayerGui and\n      Class.CoreGui do.\n    description: |\n      Allows Class.StarterGui to process input like Class.PlayerGui and\n      Class.CoreGui do.
