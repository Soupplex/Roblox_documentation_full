Class.Keyframe|Keyframes are\n  interpolated between during animation playback.\ndescription: |\n  A Keyframe holds the Class.Pose|Poses applied to joints in a Class.Model\n  at a given point of time in an animation. Class.Keyframe|Keyframes are\n  interpolated between during animation playback.\n\n  Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate\n  Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences as the animation editor covers most\n  animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to\n  generate an animation from a Class.Script or build their own plugin.\n\n  ## Structure\n\n  Keyframes are held within a Class.KeyframeSequence and contain Class.Pose\n  objects. The poses are named in accordance with the Class.BasePart|BaseParts\n  they correspond to and are structured in terms of joint hierarchy. This means\n  each Class.Pose is parented to the Class.Pose corresponding to the part it\n  is attached to.\n\n  Note, as Class.Pose|Poses are named in accordance with the\n  Class.BasePart|BaseParts they correspond to, animations require distinct\n  part names to play correctly.\n\n  ## Interpolation\n\n  During animation playback the poses in different keyframes are interpolated\n  between. This allows a smooth animation to be created without needing to\n  define every frame. Note, the style of interpolation is determined in the\n  Class.Pose object. The Keyframe object merely holds the Class.Pose|Poses\n  at a defined point of time in the animation (Class.Keyframe.Time).\ncodesamples:\n  - Keyframe-Generate-Poses\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Keyframe.Time\n    summary: |\n      The Class.Keyframe time position (in seconds) in an animation.

This determines the time at which the Class.Pose|Poses inside\n      the keyframe will be shown.\n\n      Note the Class.Keyframe with the highest time value in a\n      Class.KeyframeSequence is used to determine the length of the animation.\n    codesamples:\n      - Get-KeyframeSequence-Length\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\nmethods:\n  - name: Keyframe:AddMarker\n    summary: |\n      Adds a Class.KeyframeMarker to the Class.Keyframe by parenting it to\n      the keyframe.\n    description: |\n      This function adds a Class.KeyframeMarker to the Class.Keyframe by\n      parenting it to the keyframe.
