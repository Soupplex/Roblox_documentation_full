These surfaces, or the Inner\n  Cage and Outer Cage, are similar to collision boxes, and describe the surfaces\n  of which other 3D accessories can be placed without clipping or breaking.\n\n  Internally, WrapLayer also uses the UV layout of the Inner and Outer cages to\n  match coordinates to another 3D object's cage.
