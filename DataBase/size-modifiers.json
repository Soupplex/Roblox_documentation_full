    "content": "Alongside basic sizing of UI objects, you can utilize size modifiers to scale an object proportionally or automatically resize it. You can also insert size constraints to control aspect ratio, or set a minimum and maximum size or text size.\n\nScale\n\nA Class.UIScale object stores a numerical value that multiplies the Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize property of the parent Class.GuiObject. For example, if you want an object to be twice as large as it currently is, you can insert a Class.UIScale object with a Class.UIScale.Scale|Scale property of 2.\n\nThis modifier is useful for \"zooming in\" while designing a detailed user interface in Studio, since it proportionally scales the object and all of its children, including any applied appearance modifiers like Class.UIStroke or Class.UICorner. It's also useful to tween the size of an object, for example to slightly increase the size of a button when a player hovers their mouse over it.\n\nAutomatic sizing\n\nThe Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize property automatically resizes a parent Class.GuiObject to the size of its descendants. You can use this property in a variety of cases, including:\n\n- Expanding a Class.GuiObject to fit text that has been localized in many languages.\n- Allowing users to input text within a Class.TextBox, automatically adjusting its size based on the amount of text entered.\n- Automatically adjusting the size of text objects using rich text markup, including font type and size.\n\nYou can enable the Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize property for any Class.GuiObject. By default, it is set to Enum.AutomaticSize|None, but you can change its value to have specific control over which direction(s) the Class.GuiObject resizes to fit its content.\n\nClass.ScrollingFrame uses the Class.ScrollingFrame.AutomaticCanvasSize|AutomaticCanvasSize property instead of Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize. It behaves the same but resizes the frame's Class.ScrollingFrame.CanvasSize|CanvasSize, not its base Class.GuiObject.Size|Size.\n\nTo enable automatic sizing:\n\n1. In the Explorer window, click any Class.GuiObject, such as a Class.Frame, Class.TextBox, or Class.ImageLabel.\n2. In the Properties window, navigate to the Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize property (Class.ScrollingFrame.AutomaticCanvasSize|AutomaticCanvasSize for Class.ScrollingFrame) and set it to one of the following options:\n\n   - Enum.AutomaticSize|X &mdash; Resizes content horizontally.\n   - Enum.AutomaticSize|Y &mdash; Resizes content vertically.\n   - Enum.AutomaticSize|XY &mdash; Resizes content both horizontally and vertically.\n\n\n\nOnce automatic sizing is set, note that other object properties behave as follows:\n\nSimilar to the concept of sizing an object, Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize takes the Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint|AnchorPoint property into consideration when resizing content. For example, the following video displays three Class.TextLabel|TextLabels that automatically resize from their anchor point.\n\n- The top label has an Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint|AnchorPoint value of Datatype.Vector2.new()|(0, 0.5) which anchors it to the middle of the left side.\n- The middle label has an Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint|AnchorPoint value of Datatype.Vector2.new()|(0.5, 0.5) which anchors it to the center.\n- The bottom label has an Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint|AnchorPoint value of Datatype.Vector2.new()|(1, 0.5) which anchors it to the middle of the right side.\n\nWhen you enable Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize, the object's Class.GuiObject.Size|Size property controls its minimum size. This means that the Class.GuiObject cannot resize smaller than its core size along any axis.\n\nFor example, the following white Class.Frame has a Class.GuiObject.Size|Size of 0 for both axes, meaning it doesn't have a minimum width/height and can resize according to its child objects.\n\nIn comparison, the following white Class.Frame has a Class.GuiObject.Size|Size.X of 100, so it cannot resize to a width less than 100 pixels.\n\nWhen you enable text wrapping for a UI text object (Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped|TextLabel, Class.TextButton.TextWrapped|TextButton, or Class.TextBox.TextWrapped|TextBox) and set the Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize property to either Enum.AutomaticSize|Y or Enum.AutomaticSize|XY, the label resizes to accommodate any text that wraps across multiple lines. For example, the following Class.TextLabel has Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped|TextWrapped enabled and an Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize of Enum.AutomaticSize|Y, so when text overflows the width and wraps, the label expands vertically.\n\nConstraints\n\nThere are three types of constraints you can use for a user interface object: size, text size, and aspect ratio. To use a constraint, you must set it as a child of the Class.GuiObject you want to constrain.\n\nSize\n\nThe Class.UISizeConstraint specifies a minimum and maximum size for a Class.GuiObject. This constraint ensures that the Class.GuiObject doesn't become too small or large on different screen sizes.\n\nFor example, if you set the Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize property to (200, 200) and the Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize|MaxSize property to (400, 400), the Class.GuiObject cannot scale smaller than 200&times;200 pixels or larger than 400&times;400 pixels.\n\nWhen a UI object is under control of both a layout structure such as Class.UIListLayout and a Class.UISizeConstraint, the constraint will override the layout and control the object's size.\n\nText size\n\nThe Class.UITextSizeConstraint specifies a minimum and maximum font size for a Class.GuiObject with text, such as a Class.TextLabel, Class.TextButton, or Class.TextBox. This constraint ensures that the text within a Class.GuiObject doesn't become illegible or too large.\n\nIf you enable the Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextScaled property of the parent Class.GuiObject, the text size scales with the container's size and respects constraints even if the object becomes smaller or larger than the Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MinTextSize|MinTextSize and Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MaxTextSize|MaxTextSize values.\n\nFor example, the following Class.TextLabel object has a Class.UITextSizeConstraint with a Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MinTextSize|MinTextSize value of 50 and a MaxTextSize value of 80. Even when the Class.TextLabel becomes smaller, the font never becomes smaller than 50 pixels, and when the object becomes large, the font next exceeds 80 pixels.\n\nDo not use Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MinTextSize|MinTextSize property values lower than 9 or the text will be difficult to read for many viewers.\n\nAspect ratio\n\nThe Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint enforces a width‑to‑height aspect ratio on a Class.GuiObject regardless of its core size, even if that size is set as a percentage of its parent. For example, inserting this constraint as a child of a Class.Frame and setting the constraint's Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio property to 2 (2:1) keeps the frame's width at twice that of its height. Similarly, setting this constraint's Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio property to 0.5 (0.5:1) keeps the frame's width at half that of its height.\n\nSetting this constraint's Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio to the default of 1 (1:1) is a convenient way to prevent non‑proportional scaling/stretching of an Class.ImageLabel with a square image asset, such as an avatar thumbnail.\n\nWhen a UI object is under control of both a layout structure such as Class.UIListLayout and a Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint, the constraint will override the layout and control the object's size.",
