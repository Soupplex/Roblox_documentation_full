The\n  control which is affected depends on its name.\n\n  NumberPose instances are the building blocks of facial animation and, with\n  Class.Keyframe|Keyframes, make up\n  Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences.\n\n  #### NumberPoses and Facial Animation\n\n  Although a NumberPose is assigned to a single FACS control by name, that\n  control can in turn affect multiple bones of the face rig. FACS controls act\n  as an abstraction layer between facial muscle movements and how they are\n  defined in the rig.\n\n  #### NumberPose Hierarchy\n\n  Contrary to Class.Pose Instances, NumberPose instances cannot be\n  parented together. However, they all must be stored in a Class.Folder named\n  FaceControls that is a child of the Head Class.Pose.\n\n  #### NumberPose Value\n\n  The Roblox animation system applies NumberPose values to the corresponding\n  FACS controls. Because those controls only respond to values between 0 and 1,\n  the values calculated by the animation system are always clamped to that\n  range.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - PoseBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: NumberPose.Value\n    summary: |\n      The value that will be applied to the FACS control corresponding to the\n      Class.NumberPose.\n    description: |\n      The value that will be applied to the FACS control corresponding with the\n      Class.NumberPose.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: double\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
