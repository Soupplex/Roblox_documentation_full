The Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity\\n  property, not to be confused with Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity,\\n  controls the goal velocity.\\n\\n  Class.BodyVelocity is the linear counterpart to Class.BodyAngularVelocity.\\n  If you need the assembly to move toward a goal position, use\\n  Class.BodyPosition instead. If you need further control on a force applied\\n  to an object, consider using a Class.BodyForce or Class.BodyThrust\\n  instead.\\n\\n  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several\\n  factors, namely the difference between the assembly's current velocity and the\\n  goal velocity. This is multiplied by Class.BodyVelocity.P|P (power) to\\n  either amplify or diminish it. The resulting force is then capped by\\n  Class.BodyVelocity.MaxForce|MaxForce.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
