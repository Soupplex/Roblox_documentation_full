The attachments can move closer\n  together than this length and both can freely rotate. This constraint can also\n  be powered to behave as a motorized winch.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Winch\n\n  If a rope's Class.RopeConstraint.WinchEnabled|WinchEnabled property is\n  enabled, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set separation\n  specified by Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget, effectively the\n  target length of the rope in studs. This translation is controlled by\n  Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed,\n  Class.RopeConstraint.WinchResponsiveness|WinchResponsiveness, and\n  Class.RopeConstraint.WinchForce|WinchForce.\n\n  Note that Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed must be a positive\n  value, used to either contract or extend the rope length to\n  Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget. Setting a negative speed will\n  revert to 0, not reverse the winch servo direction.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: RopeConstraint.CurrentDistance\n    summary: |\n      The current distance between the constraint's\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.\n    description: |\n      The current distance between the constraint's\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Derived\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: RopeConstraint.Length\n    summary: |\n      The maximum distance apart the two Class.Attachment|Attachments can be.\n    description: |\n      The maximum distance apart the two Class.Attachment|Attachments can be.\n      Measured in studs.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Rope\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: RopeConstraint.Restitution\n    summary: |\n      Elasticity of the Class.Attachment|Attachments connected by the\n      constraint when reaching the maximum defined\n      Class.RopeConstraint.Length|Length.
