    "content": "Roblox offers a secrets store for each experience. Secrets are sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and access tokens that you use to authenticate with external services. For example, if you want to connect to a third-party analytics or music service, you likely need to use an API key to authenticate with it.\n\nYou could copy and paste the API key into a script or add it to a data store, but those approaches carry unnecessary security risks. The better solution is to use the secrets store and access the key using a small set of secure methods.\n\nAdd secrets\n\nTo view, create, or edit secrets, you must be the experience owner or group owner. You can have up to 500 secrets per experience.\n\n1. Navigate to the Creator Dashboard.\n2. Select your experience, and then select Secrets ⟩ Create Secret.\n3. Enter a name, the secret, and the applicable domain.\n\n   - The name acts as a unique identifier for the secret, so we recommend something descriptive.\n   - Secrets can be up to 1,024 characters in length. API keys and access tokens should come from the service provider, but if the secret is a password, you probably created it yourself.\n   - You can use a limited wildcard syntax for the domain, such as  for any domain (not recommended) or .example.com for any subdomain at example.com. Specific domains are even better, such as my.example.com.\n\nYou can also use Open Cloud to manage your secrets. See the reference documentation and guide.\n\nLocal secrets\n\nFor security reasons, the secrets store for each experience is only available to live servers or collaborative testing environments. If you try to access a secret during local playtesting, you receive a Can't find secret with given key error. You receive an identical error if you try to access secrets from a client script.\n\nTo specify secrets for local testing, go to Studio and then go to File ⟩ Experience Settings ⟩ Security. You can create new secrets and edit or delete existing secrets in the Secrets section.\n\nUse secrets\n\nBefore using secrets within your experience, you must enable Allow HTTP Requests in the Security section of Studio's File ⟩ Experience Settings window. Then call Class.HttpService:GetSecret() within a server script:\n\nlua\nlocal HttpService = game:GetService(\"HttpService\")\n\nlocal testSecret = HttpService:GetSecret(\"testsecret\")\n\nPart of the appeal of using secret stores is that you can't accidentally print a secret. Instead of the secret itself, the following code outputs the name you provided when creating the secret:\n\nlua\nprint(testSecret) --> Secret(testsecret)\n\nYou can't manipulate the string directly. Instead, the Datatype.Secret data type lets you add a prefix and suffix to the secret to help form a URL or insert content like Bearer:\n\nlua\nlocal HttpService = game:GetService(\"HttpService\")\n\nlocal testSecret = HttpService:GetSecret(\"testsecret\")\n\nlocal prefix = \"https://my.example.com/endpoint?apiKey=\"\nlocal suffix = \"&user=username\"\nlocal url = testSecret:AddPrefix(prefix)\nurl = url:AddSuffix(suffix)\nprint(url) --> https://my.example.com/endpoint?apiKey=Secret(testsecret)&user=username\n\nAfter you have a URL with the secret inserted, you can make standard HTTP requests using methods like Class.HttpService:RequestAsync(). Of course, you can ignore these methods and insert the secret directly into a header, too.\n\nYou can't include secrets in the HTTP request body, only the URL and headers.",
