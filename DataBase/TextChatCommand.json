For an example of\n  custom commands, see\n  Custom text chat commands.\n\n  To learn more about using Class.TextChatService, see\n  In-experience text chat.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TextChatCommand.AutocompleteVisible\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\n  - name: TextChatCommand.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the Class.TextChatCommand is enabled.\n    description: |\n      Determines whether the Class.TextChatCommand is enabled.\n\n      When disabled, messages that match the value of\n      Class.TextChatCommand.PrimaryAlias|PrimaryAlias or\n      Class.TextChatCommand.SecondaryAlias|SecondaryAlias are not sunk and is\n      sent to other users.\n\n      Use this to disable default commands on a case-by-case basis.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\n  - name: TextChatCommand.PrimaryAlias\n    summary: |\n      A primary alias used to trigger the Class.TextChatCommand.\n    description: |\n      A primary alias used to trigger the Class.TextChatCommand.\n\n      If a user sends a message with Class.TextChannel:SendAsync() that\n      matches the Class.TextChatCommand.PrimaryAlias|PrimaryAlias, the message\n      is not sent and instead Class.TextChatCommand.Triggered is fired.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\n  - name: TextChatCommand.SecondaryAlias\n    summary: |\n      A secondary alias used to trigger the Class.TextChatCommand.\n    description: |\n      A secondary alias used to trigger the Class.TextChatCommand.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Chat\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: TextChatCommand.Triggered\n    summary: |\n      An event that developers can bind to execute commands.\n    description: |\n      An event that developers can bind to execute commands.\n\n      When a user sends a message to the server via\n      Class.TextChannel:SendAsync(), the message is intercepted by the\n      Class.TextChatCommand and not replicated to other users if the content\n      of the message matches the\n      Class.TextChatCommand.PrimaryAlias|PrimaryAlias or\n      Class.TextChatCommand.SecondaryAlias|SecondaryAlias.\n\n      For example, for a Class.TextChatCommand with\n      Class.TextChatCommand.PrimaryAlias as \"mute\", if a user sends \"/mute\n      SomeUserName\", then the relevant Class.TextChatCommand for mute will\n      fire its Class.TextChatCommand.Triggered.
