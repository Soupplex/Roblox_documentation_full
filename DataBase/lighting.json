    "content": "The Class.Lighting service contains properties that you can adjust to update\nand customize the global lighting in an experience. There are five categories of\nlighting properties:\n\n- Color &mdash; Configures hue within the experience.\n- Intensity &mdash; Configures the intensity or amount of light hitting the camera.\n- Shadows &mdash; Configures how a user experiences shadows within the experience.\n- Appearance &mdash; Properties that determine the lighting style and lighting/shading quality or view distance prioritization.\n- Environment &mdash; Configures the conditions of the experience's world, such as the time of day and geographic latitude.\n\nColor\n\nAmbient\n\nThe Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient property sets a hue for the entirety of an experience. This property affects the lighting for both outdoor and indoor environments.\n\nOutdoorAmbient\n\nThe Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient|OutdoorAmbient\nproperty sets a hue for outdoor areas of an experience. This can\nhelp simulate how the ambient color of real-life lighting changes\nthroughout the day. For example, sunlight in the early morning or late\nafternoon is usually warmer and more pink and orange in tone, while late\nevening is usually cooler and more blue and purple in tone.\n\nIn the following images, note that the lighting inside the garage and cafe doesn't change like it would if you were changing the Ambient property.\n\nColorShiftTop\n\nThe Class.Lighting.ColorShiftTop|ColorShiftTop property sets a hue that reflects from surfaces facing the sun or moon.\n\nColorShiftBottom\n\nThe Class.Lighting.ColorShiftBottom|ColorShiftBottom property sets a hue that reflects from surfaces that are facing away from the sun or moon.\n\nIn the following images, note the hue change on the sandstone wall facing away from the sun.\n\nIntensity\n\nBrightness\n\nThe Class.Lighting.Brightness|Brightness property sets the intensity of illumination. This can help increase the contrast between brightly illuminated areas and shadows, simulating bright sunshine and warmer weather.\n\nExposureCompensation\n\nThe Class.Lighting.ExposureCompensation|ExposureCompensation property applies exposure to an experience. Exposure is the amount of light that reaches the camera.\n\nA lower value is similar to under-exposure in photography, while a higher value is similar to over-exposure.\n\nShadows\n\nGlobalShadows\n\nWhen enabled, the Class.Lighting.GlobalShadows|GlobalShadows property renders shadows.\n\nShadowSoftness\n\nThe Class.Lighting.ShadowSoftness|ShadowSoftness property adjusts how blurry shadows are from a value of 0 (hard edges) to 1 (soft edges). This property is only valid when Class.Lighting.LightingStyle|LightingStyle is set to Enum.LightingStyle|Realistic.\n\nAppearance\n\nLightingStyle\n\nClass.Lighting.LightingStyle|LightingStyle indicates the artistic intent behind lighting in the experience, as an Enum.LightingStyle option. Enum.LightingStyle|Realistic provides the most advanced and realistic lighting and shadows Roblox can deliver, while Enum.LightingStyle|Soft produces a flat, retro‑Roblox look with softer lights and shadows.\n\nPrioritizeLightingQuality\n\nThe Class.Lighting.PrioritizeLightingQuality|PrioritizeLightingQuality property indicates whether you prefer lighting/shading quality or view distance to scale down first. As the rendering quality level reduces, a setting of true prioritizes features such as advanced shadows and high‑quality shaders at closer distances, while a setting of false prioritizes view distance. If lighting and shadows are very important to the artistic feel of your experience, set this to true.\n\nEnvironment\n\nClockTime and TimeOfDay\n\nThe Class.Lighting.ClockTime|ClockTime and Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay|TimeOfDay property both represent the current time of day in hours, and they are directly related; if you change one property, the other also changes.\n\nThe only difference between these properties is their numeric value; Class.Lighting.ClockTime|ClockTime represents time from hour 0 through 24 while\nClass.Lighting.TimeOfDay|TimeOfDay represents time through a 24 hour string.\n\nNote that each property doesn't follow the actual time of day, and they will not change during an experience unless changed through a script.\n\nGeographicLatitude\n\nThe Class.Lighting.GeographicLatitude|GeographicLatitude property represents the geographic latitude in degrees. Note that while this property changes the position of the sun and moon, it does not change the Class.Lighting.ClockTime|ClockTime and Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay|TimeOfDay properties.\n\nEnvironmentDiffuseScale\n\nThe Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale|EnvironmentDiffuseScale property determines how much ambient light is derived from the environment.\n\nIn the following images, note how the ambient light changes, particularly inside the kitchen of the ramen shop.\n\nEnvironmentSpecularScale\n\nThe Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale|EnvironmentSpecularScale\nproperty determines how much specular light is derived from the\nenvironment. When set near a value of 1, smooth objects better reflect\nthe environment and metal appears more realistic.",
