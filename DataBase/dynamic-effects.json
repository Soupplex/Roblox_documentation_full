    "content": "There is a newer set of audio effects that offer more control and address robust use cases. For more information, see Audio effects.\n\nDynamic effects modify or enhance the audio of individual Class.Sound objects or an entire Class.SoundGroup. You can apply these effects to make your audio more immersive within your experience, such as using Class.ReverbSoundEffect in large rooms to make them feel massive.\n\nApply dynamic effects\n\nEach dynamic effect you apply has additional properties you can adjust until you achieve the type of sound you desire. For more information on these properties, see each dynamic effect's API page.\n\nTo apply a dynamic effect:\n\n1. In the Explorer window, insert a new dynamic effect into a Class.Sound or Class.SoundGroup object.\n\n   1. Hover over the object and click the ⊕ button. A contextual menu displays.\n   2. From the menu, insert a dynamic effect.\n\n\n\n2. (Optional) In the Properties window, select the new dynamic effect and adjust its properties.\n\n\n\nTypes\n\nEqualizer\n\nThe Class.EqualizerSoundEffect allows for control of the volume of various frequency ranges. This dynamic effect is useful to highlight or minimize particular elements of audio, such as muffling all audio in your experience when a user goes underwater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with equalizer\n\n\nCompressor\n\nThe Class.CompressorSoundEffect reduces the dynamic range of audio by lowering the volume of the highest parts of a source while at the same time raising the overall volume. This dynamic effect is useful to set a consistent volume for users to hear even if you record audio while whispering or speaking loudly. You can also use this dynamic effect to prioritize sounds from one Class.SoundGroup over another through the process of ducking. For more information, see Ducking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with compressor\n\n\nReverb\n\nThe Class.ReverbSoundEffect simulates the effect of sounds bouncing off of several surfaces. This dynamic effect is useful to simulate more realistic reflections of sounds in interior spaces, such as bouncing a basketball inside a gymnasium, or playing rock music in a stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with reverb\n\n\nChorus\n\nThe Class.ChorusSoundEffect simulates the effect of multiple vocals or instruments playing simultaneously by taking the original sound and overlaying copies, each with slight variations in pitch. This dynamic effect is useful for simulating a robotic or futuristic quality to your audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with chorus\n\n\nDistortion\n\nThe Class.DistortionSoundEffect simulates the effect that would occur when overdriving older style audio equipment. This dynamic effect causes clipping in the sound and adds a general \"fuzziness\", which is useful for either adding intensity and character to musical instruments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with distortion\n\n\nEcho\n\nThe Class.EchoSoundEffect causes a sound to repeat on a delay with diminishing volume, simulating the real effect of an echo that bounces off of hard surfaces, such as walls and caves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with echo\n\n\nFlange\n\nThe Class.FlangeSoundEffect creates a sweeping or whooshing effect by copying the original audio signal and playing it slightly offset and modulated on top of the original. This dynamic effect is useful for adding strange, otherworldly digital quality to your audio. For example, you can use it on an air conditioner recording to make a sci-fi spaceship engine rumble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with flange\n\n\nPitch Shift\n\nThe Class.PitchShiftSoundEffect raises or lowers pitch without changing the playback speed. This dynamic effect is useful for changing the scale of your sounds. You can use it to make small sounds feel huge by pitching them down or conversely pitch sounds up to make an explosion sound more like a balloon pop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with pitch shift\n\n\nTremolo\n\nThe Class.TremoloSoundEffect creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying its volume up and down. This dynamic effect is useful to transform instrument sounds into a wavy, dreamlike quality, or to create swells and dips in weather-related audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Audio without effect\n    Audio with tremolo",
