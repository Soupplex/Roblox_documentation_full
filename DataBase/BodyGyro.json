This allows\\n  for the creation of assemblies that point in a certain direction, as if a real\\n  gyroscope were acting upon it. Essentially, it's the rotational counterpart to\\n  a Class.BodyPosition.\\n\\n  If you would like to maintain a constant angular velocity, use a\\n  Class.BodyAngularVelocity instead.\\n\\n  The Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame property controls the goal orientation.\\n  Only the angular components of the Datatype.CFrame are used; position will\\n  make no difference. Class.BodyGyro.MaxTorque|MaxTorque limits the amount of\\n  angular force that may be applied, Class.BodyGyro.P|P controls the power\\n  used in achieving the goal orientation, and Class.BodyGyro.D|D controls\\n  dampening behavior.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.

When the assembly\\n      approaches the goal orientation, it needs to decelerate, otherwise it will\\n      rotate past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate back toward the\\n      goal. This often creates an undesirable \\\"rubber‑banding\\\" effect, avoided\\n      by applying dampening. The higher this value is set, the greater the\\n      dampening curve becomes, or the slower the assembly will approach the goal\\n      orientation.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Goals\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Physics\\n  - name: BodyGyro.MaxTorque\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the limit on how much torque that may be applied to each axis.\\n    description: |\\n      This property determines the limit on the amount of torque that may be\\n      applied on each axis in reaching the goal orientation\\n      (Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame).
