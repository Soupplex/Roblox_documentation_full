You can adjust their appearance through the Class.Clouds object to create unique atmospheres such as stormy skies, stunning sunsets, and alien worlds. You can also customize their direction and speed through global wind.\\n\\nEnable clouds\\n\\nYou can manage dynamic clouds in an experience through the Class.Clouds object. While you can place this object anywhere for organization or replication purposes, clouds only render if you parent the object under the Class.Terrain class.\\n\\nTo enable dynamic clouds:\\n\\n1. In the Explorer window, hover over Terrain and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\\n1. From the menu, insert Clouds.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Adjust the appearance of clouds through the new object's properties.\\n1. Set the clouds in motion through global wind.\\n\\nCloud properties\\n\\nFrom the Class.Clouds object under Class.Terrain, you can adjust the appearance of clouds through the Properties window.\\n\\nCover\\n\\nThe Class.Clouds.Cover|Cover property controls how much the clouds span across the overall skyscape layer from a value of 0 (sparse cloud cover) to 1 (full cloud cover).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDensity\\n\\nThe Class.Clouds.Density|Density property controls the intensity of the particles that make up each cloud, mainly affecting their transparency. For example, lower values produce light, semi-translucent clouds, and higher values produce heavy, dark clouds with a stormy appearance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nColor\\n\\nThe Class.Clouds.Color|Color property controls the material color of cloud particles. It's important to note that several Class.Lighting and Class.Atmosphere properties also influence cloud color, so if you want to simulate specific atmospheres, experiment with multiple properties until you have the effect you want.\",\n    \"source\": \"clouds.md\"\n}ionmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Appearance\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: Clouds.Density\\n    summary: |\\n      Controls the particulate density of clouds.\\n    description: |\\n      This property controls the particulate density of clouds (the proportion\\n      of airborne water vapor particles at full cloud cover).\\n\\n      See the Dynamic Clouds\\n      article for a summary of properties and expected results.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Appearance\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: Clouds.Enabled\\n    summary: |\\n      Toggles rendering of the Class.Clouds object.\\n    description: |\\n      This property toggles rendering of the Class.Clouds object.
