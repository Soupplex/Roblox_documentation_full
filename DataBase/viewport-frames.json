    "content": "A Class.ViewportFrame uses a camera to render 3D objects into a 2D viewport. Ideal use cases include:\n\n- A minimap of your experience directly in the corner of a user's screen.\n- 3D models of items in an inventory menu.\n- Rotating objects that a character has equipped.\n\nViewport configurations\n\n3D objects that users view through a Class.ViewportFrame can either move with their camera, remain static, or rotate within the Class.ViewportFrame. This object can also include a Class.Sky child as a cubemap for reflections.\n\nIf you want a 3D object to move with the camera:\n\n1. Position your camera view within the experience so that the object you want to see within the frame is visible.\n2. Add a new Class.ViewportFrame to the screen and then make sure it's selected in the Explorer.\n3. In the Properties window, assign the Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera property to the camera:\n\n\t 1. Select the Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera property. Your cursor changes.\n\t 2. In the Explorer window, click on the top-level Class.Camera object.\n\n4. Parent the desired 3D object to the new Class.ViewportFrame. Note that if you still want to see the object within your experience, you must duplicate it in the Class.Workspace and then parent the duplicate object to the Class.ViewportFrame.\n\nWhen you move your camera, the object will also move within the Class.ViewportFrame.\n\nWhen you want to update the view of your Class.ViewportFrame, be sure to update the camera, not the objects within the view.\n\nIf you want the 3D object to remain static:\n\n1. Position your camera view within the experience so that the object you want to see is in the exact position you want to see it within the frame.\n2. In the Explorer window, duplicate the top-level Class.Camera object, then rename it to an identifiable name like ViewportCam.\n3. Add a new Class.ViewportFrame to the screen and then make sure it's selected in the Explorer.\n4. In the Properties window, assign the frame's Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera property to the duplicated camera:\n\n\t 1. Select the Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera property. Your cursor changes.\n\t 2. In the Explorer window, click on the duplicated camera object.\n\n5. Parent the desired 3D object to the new Class.ViewportFrame. Note that if you still want to see the object within your experience, you must duplicate it in the Class.Workspace and then parent the duplicate object to the Class.ViewportFrame.\n\nIf you want a 3D object such as a Class.BasePart to rotate on its own within the frame:\n\n1. Add a new Class.ViewportFrame to the screen.\n2. In the Explorer window, drag the desired Class.BasePart into the new Class.ViewportFrame.\n3. Insert a new Class.LocalScript into the Class.ViewportFrame and paste in the following code.\n\n\tlua\n\tlocal RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\n\tlocal viewportFrame = script.Parent\n\n\t-- Parameters to experiment with\n\tlocal cameraDistance = 10\n\tlocal cameraFieldOfView = 50\n\tlocal objectPitchAngle = 40\n\tlocal objectRotationSpeed = 50\n\n\t-- Viewport camera initialization\n\tlocal viewportCamera = Instance.new(\"Camera\")\n\tviewportCamera.FieldOfView = cameraFieldOfView\n\tviewportFrame.CurrentCamera = viewportCamera\n\tviewportCamera.Parent = viewportFrame\n\n\t-- Viewport object initialization\n\tlocal object = viewportFrame:FindFirstChildWhichIsA(\"BasePart\")\n\tif object then\n\t\tobject.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 0, 0)  CFrame.Angles(math.rad(objectPitchAngle), 0, 0)\n\n\t\t-- Update loop\n\t\tlocal t = 0\n\t\tRunService.PostSimulation:Connect(function(delta)\n\t\t\tt += delta\n\t\t\tviewportCamera.CFrame = CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(t  objectRotationSpeed), 0)  CFrame.new(0, 0, cameraDistance)\n\t\tend)\n\telse\n\t\twarn(\"3D object not found as child of viewport frame\")\n\tend\n\n\nClass.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames can use a Class.Sky child as a cubemap for reflections, in which case only the Class.Sky object's six Skybox[…] properties are used. Assuming these properties are valid, lighting inside the Class.ViewportFrame acts similarly to when Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale and Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale are both set to 1.\n\nTo implement skybox cubemap reflections:\n\n1. Insert a Class.Sky object as a direct child of the Class.ViewportFrame.\n1. Set the Class.Sky object's six texture properties (Class.Sky.SkyboxBk|SkyboxBk, Class.Sky.SkyboxDn|SkyboxDn, Class.Sky.SkyboxFt|SkyboxFt, Class.Sky.SkyboxLf|SkyboxLf, Class.Sky.SkyboxRt|SkyboxRt, Class.Sky.SkyboxUp|SkyboxUp).\n1. For Class.Part|Parts that should appear within the frame, set their Class.BasePart.Reflectance|Reflectance property greater than 0, or use a reflectant material like Enum.Material.Glass|Glass or Enum.Material.Foil|Foil. For Class.MeshPart|MeshParts that should appear within the frame, apply a Class.SurfaceAppearance with a properly-configured Class.SurfaceAppearance.MetalnessMap|MetalnessMap.\n\nLighting and appearance\n\nLighting within a Class.ViewportFrame is controlled through three properties:\n\n\n\n      Property\n      Description\n\n\n\n\n      Class.ViewportFrame.Ambient|Ambient\n      Determines the overall lighting hue applied to the area within the viewport frame. Defaults to Datatype.Color3.fromRGB(200, 200, 200) (ghost grey).\n\n\n      Class.ViewportFrame.LightDirection|LightDirection\n      A Datatype.Vector3 representing the direction of the light source from position (0, 0, 0). Defaults to (-1, -1, -1).\n\n\n      Class.ViewportFrame.LightColor|LightColor\n      Color of the directional light. Defaults to Datatype.Color3.fromRGB(140, 140, 140) (silver).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can adjust the overall rendered appearance of the viewport throuugh the following properties:\n\n\n\n      Property\n      Description\n\n\n\n\n      Class.ViewportFrame.ImageColor3|ImageColor3\n      Changes the image color/tint without modification of the rendered object. The default colorization value is Datatype.Color3.new(1, 1, 1) (white) at which no color modification occurs.\n\n\n      Class.ViewportFrame.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency\n      Changes the image transparency without modification of the rendered object. A value of 0 (default) is completely opaque and a value of 1 is completely transparent (invisible).",
