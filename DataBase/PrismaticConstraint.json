This constrains the attachments so that their X axes are collinear\n  but pointing in opposite directions. It also constrains the attachments so\n  that their Y axes are parallel.\n\n  This constraint inherits many properties from Class.SlidingBallConstraint\n  including Class.SlidingBallConstraint.ActuatorType|ActuatorType,\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled,\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint.Velocity|Velocity, and more. Please refer to\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint for details on configuring a\n  Class.PrismaticConstraint.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SlidingBallConstraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
