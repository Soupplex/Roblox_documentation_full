It allows the user to initiate\n  a single, one-off action in Roblox Studio through the\n  Class.PluginToolbarButton.Click|Click event. Toolbar buttons can also be\n  assigned a keyboard shortcut through Studio's File ⟩ Customize\n  Shortcuts window.\n\n  When pressed, the Class.PluginToolbarButton.Click|Click event fires. A\n  button will also remain in the pressed state, which may be set manually using\n  Class.PluginToolbarButton:SetActive()|SetActive(). Upon plugin activation\n  (Class.Plugin:Activate()), buttons in all other\n  Class.PluginToolbar|PluginToolbars will be toggled off. If all buttons in a\n  toolbar are off, the toolbar's plugin is deactivated\n  (Class.Plugin:Deactivate()).\n\n  When the game viewport is not visible, buttons will be disabled as if their\n  Class.PluginToolbarButton.Enabled|Enabled property were false. Disabled\n  buttons are desaturated and do not respond to user clicks. By setting\n  Class.PluginToolbarButton.ClickableWhenViewportHidden|ClickableWhenViewportHidden\n  to true, you can allow plugin buttons to remain clickable, such as during\n  script editing.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PluginToolbarButton.ClickableWhenViewportHidden\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the button can be clicked when the 3D viewport is\n      hidden, such as when a Class.Script is being edited in another tab.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether a Class.PluginToolbarButton may be\n      clicked while the 3D viewport is hidden, such as when a Class.Script is\n      being edited in another tab.\n\n      Typically, this property should be enabled if an action triggered by a\n      plugin button's Class.PluginToolbarButton.Click|Click event doesn't\n      occur in the 3D world (Class.Workspace). For example, a button that\n      opens a widget should have this property as true, since showing a widget\n      is visible to the user even if the 3D view isn't visible.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PluginToolbarButton.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the button is clickable in general.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether a button is clickable in general.

For example, a plugin button that assigns random\n      colors to selected should not be enabled when the selection contains no\n      parts.\n\n      See also\n      Class.PluginToolbarButton.ClickableWhenViewportHidden|ClickableWhenViewportHidden\n      which determines whether a button is clickable when the game view is\n      hidden (and not just in general).\n    codesamples:\n      - brickcolor-randomizer-plugin\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PluginToolbarButton.Icon\n    summary: |\n      Determines what icon should represent the button.\n    description: |\n      This property determines which Datatype.Content should be shown for the\n      button's icon in the toolbar.
