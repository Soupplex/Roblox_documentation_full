It is generally used to hold Tools,\n  but is sometimes used to hold Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts to ensure that\n  each player gets a copy.\n\n  When a player's character spawns, the contents of the StarterPack and their\n  Class.StarterGear are copied into their Class.Backpack. Once a character\n  dies, the Class.Backpack is removed and a new one is created -- populating\n  it using the contents of Class.StarterPack and Class.StarterGear.\n\n  The StarterPack is used to determine a set of Class.Tool|Tools that all\n  players will spawn with. If a developer wants to ensure that certain\n  Class.Tool|Tools are available to specific players, then they will need to\n  parent the Class.Tool|Tools directly to the player's Class.Backpack\n  instead.\n\n  Note: while normally the contents of Class.StarterPack are predefined, the\n  contents can be changed while the game is running by adding and removing\n  Class.Tool|Tools accordingly. These updates will pass onto a player's\n  backpack when they respawn and their backpacks are reloaded. Changes to the\n  StarterPack should be made by the server.\n\n  A tool can be added to the StarterPack using the following code.\n\n      Tool.Parent = game:GetService(\"StarterPack\")\ncodesamples:\n  - Empty-StarterPack\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
