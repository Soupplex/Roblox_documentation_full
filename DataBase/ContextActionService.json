For example, allowing\n  a player to open a door only while close by. In code, an action is simply a\n  string (the name of the action) used by the service to differentiate between\n  unique actions. The action string is provided to\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction and\n  Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction, among other member\n  functions. If two actions are bound to the same input, the most recently bound\n  will take priority. When the most recent action is unbound, the one bound\n  before that takes control again. Since this service deals with user input, you\n  can only use it in client-side Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts.\n\n  #### Context and Action\n\n  A context is simply a condition during which a player may perform some\n  action. Some examples include holding a Class.Tool, being\n  Class.Seat|seated in a car or standing near a door. Whatever the case may\n  be, it is up to your Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts to call\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction when the context is\n  entered and Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction when the\n  context is left.\n\n  An action is simply some input that can be performed by the player while\n  in that context. Such an action could open/close some menu, trigger a\n  secondary tool action or send a request to the server using\n  Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(). An action is identified by a unique\n  string as the first parameter of both\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction and\n  Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction. The string can be\n  anything, but it should reflect the action being performed, not the input\n  being used. For example, don't use \"KeyH\" as an action name - use \"CarHorn\"\n  instead. It is best to define your actions as a constant at the top of your\n  script since you will use it in at least three different places in your code.\n\n  #### Binding Actions Contextually\n\n  It's better to use ContextActionService's\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction than\n  Class.UserInputService.InputBegan for most cases. For\n  Class.UserInputService.InputBegan, your connected function would have to\n  check if the player is in the context of the action being performed. In most\n  cases, this is harder than just calling a function when a context is entered/\n  left. For example, if you want to have the H key trigger a car horn sound\n  while the player is sitting in it, the player might type \"hello\" in chat or\n  otherwise use the H key for something else. It is harder to determine if\n  something else is using the H key (like chat) - the car might honk when the\n  player didn't mean to. If you instead use\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction and\n  Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction when the player\n  enters/leaves the car, Class.ContextActionService will make sure that H\n  key presses trigger the honk action only when it is the most recently bound\n  action. If something else (like chat) takes control, you won't have to worry\n  about checking that.\n\n  #### Inspecting Bound Actions\n\n  To see a list of actions and their bound inputs, you can inspect the \"Action\n  Bindings\" tab in the Developer Console (F9 while in game). This shows all\n  bindings, including those bound by Roblox core scripts and default\n  camera/control scripts too. This is useful for debugging if your actions are\n  being bound/unbound at the correct times, or if some other action is stealing\n  input from your actions. For example, if you are attempting to bind\n  WASD, it may be the case that\n  default character movement scripts are binding over those same keys.\n  Similarly, the camera control script can steal right-click input if the script\n  runs after yours.\n\n  #### Keyboardless Input\n\n  This service is especially useful for supporting gamepad and touch input. For\n  gamepad input, you might choose to bind the B button to an action that returns\n  the user to the previous menu when they enter another menu. For touch,\n  on-screen touch buttons can be used in place of key presses: these buttons\n  display only while the action is bound, and the position, text and/or images\n  of these buttons can be configured through this service. They're somewhat\n  limited in the amount of customization provided by this service; it's usually\n  a better idea to make your own on-screen buttons using Class.ImageButton or\n  Class.TextButton.\ncodesamples:\n  - ContextActionService-Tool-Reload\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: ContextActionService:BindAction\n    summary: |\n      Bind user input to an action given an action handling function.\n    description: |\n      Bind an action to user input given an action handling function. Upon a\n      matching input being performed, the action handler function will be called\n      with the arguments listed below. Valid input enum items include those\n      within the following: Enum.KeyCode, Enum.UserInputType or\n      Enum.PlayerActions . Call this function when a player enters the\n      context in which an action can be performed. When the player leaves the\n      context, call Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction()\n      with the same actionName.\n\n      The code sample below shows how a Class.Sound can be\n      Class.Sound:Play()|played while a key (H), game pad button,\n      or touch screen button is pressed.\n\n      lua\n      local ContextActionService = game:GetService(\"ContextActionService\")\n\n      -- A car horn sound\n      local honkSound = Instance.new(\"Sound\", workspace)\n      honkSound.Looped = true\n      honkSound.SoundId = \"rbxassetid://9120386436\"\n\n      local function handleAction(actionName, inputState, inputObject)\n      \tif actionName == \"HonkHorn\" then\n      \t\tif inputState == Enum.UserInputState.Begin then\n      \t\t\thonkSound:Play()\n      \t\telse\n      \t\t\thonkSound:Pause()\n      \t\tend\n      \tend\n      end\n\n      -- When the player sits in the vehicle:\n      ContextActionService:BindAction(\"HonkHorn\", handleAction, true, Enum.KeyCode.H, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonY)\n\n      -- When the player gets out:\n      ContextActionService:UnbindAction(\"HonkHorn\")\n\n\n      #### Action Handler Parameters\n\n      The action handler functions are called with the following parameters:\n\n\n\n        #\n        Type\n        Description\n\n\n        1\n        string\n        The same string that was originally passed to Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction().\n        This allows one function to handle multiple actions at once, if necessary.\n\n\n        2\n        Enum.UserInputState\n        The state of the input. Enum.UserInputState|Cancel is sent\n        if some input was in progress and another action bound over that in-progress\n        input, or if the in-progress bound action was unbound through Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction().\n\n\n        3\n        InputObject\n        An object that contains information about the input (varies based on\n        Enum.UserInputType). The Class.InputObject sometimes won't match the inputs the action\n        was bound to: when the Enum.UserInputState|Cancel state is sent, this object will be\n        Enum.KeyCode.Unknown and Enum.UserInputType.None.\n\n\n\n      #### Action Bindings Stack\n\n      Action bindings behave like a stack: if two actions are bound to the same\n      user input, the most recently bound action handler will be used. If an\n      action handler returns Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass, the next most\n      recently bound action handler will be called, and so on until a handler\n      sinks the input (by returning nil or Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink).\n      When Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction is called,\n      the action handler is removed from the stack. This stack behavior can be\n      overridden using\n      Class.ContextActionService:BindActionAtPriority()|BindActionAtPriority,\n      where an additional priority parameter after createTouchButton may\n      override the order in which actions are bound (higher before lower).\n\n      #### Touch Buttons\n\n      In addition to input types, this function's third parameter controls\n      whether a button is created for\n      Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled devices. Upon the first\n      touch button's creation, a Class.ScreenGui named \"ContextActionGui\" is\n      added to the Class.PlayerGui. Inside the ScreenGui is a Class.Frame\n      called \"ContextButtonFrame\" is added. It is in this frame in which\n      Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons for bound actions are parented; you can\n      use Class.ContextActionService:GetButton()|GetButton() to retrieve such\n      buttons for customization. A maximum of 7 touch buttons can be created\n      through Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction().\n    codesamples:\n      - ContextActionService-Tool-Reload\n      - General-Action-Handler\n      - Stacked-Action-Handlers\n    parameters:\n      - name: actionName\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A string representing the action being performed (e.g. \"HonkHorn\" or\n          \"OpenDoor\").\n      - name: functionToBind\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The action-handling function, called with the following parameters\n          when the bound inputs are triggered: string (actionName),\n          Enum.UserInputState and an InputObject.\n      - name: createTouchButton\n        type: boolean\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Whether a GUI button should be created for the action on touch input\n          devices.\n      - name: inputTypes\n        type: Tuple\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Any number of Enum.KeyCode or Enum.UserInputType representing the\n          inputs to bind to the action.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: ContextActionService:BindActionAtPriority\n    summary: |\n      Behaves like Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction but also\n      allows a priority to be assigned to the bound action for overlapping input\n      types (higher before lower).\n    description: |\n      BindActionAtPriority behaves like\n      Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction but also allows a\n      priority to be assigned to the bound action. If multiple actions are bound\n      to the same input, the higher priority function is called regardless of\n      the order in which the actions were bound. In other words, this function\n      overrides the normal \"stack\" behavior of BindAction.\n    codesamples:\n      - contextactionservice-bindaction-priorities\n    parameters:\n      - name: actionName\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A string representing the action being performed (e.g. \"HonkHorn\" or\n          \"OpenDoor\").\n      - name: functionToBind\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The action-handling function, called with the following parameters\n          when the bound inputs are triggered: string (actionName),\n          Enum.UserInputState and an InputObject.\n      - name: createTouchButton\n        type: boolean\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Whether a GUI button should be created for the action on touch input\n          devices.\n      - name: priorityLevel\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The priority level at which the action should be bound (higher\n          considered before lower).\n      - name: inputTypes\n        type: Tuple\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Any number of Enum.KeyCode or Enum.UserInputType representing the\n          inputs to bind to the action.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: ContextActionService:BindActionToInputTypes\n    summary: |\n      Binds functionToBind to input events such as key presses, mouse\n      movement, or controller input.\n    description: |\n      This function binds functionToBind to input events such as key presses,\n      mouse movement, or controller input. The specific input types the engine\n      listens for are listed as parameters of BindAction. Whenever a player uses\n      any of these input types, the Roblox Engine calls \"functionToBind\".\n      BindAction sets the priorityLevel via Enum.ContextActionPriority to\n      Default.Value, which is 2000. Use Class.ContextActionService:GetButton()\n      to control the priority of bound events.\n\n      In addition to input types, BindAction has a createTouchButton parameter.\n      When this is set to true it creates an Class.ImageButton on any device\n      with a touchscreen. A Class.ScreenGui is also created to put the context\n      buttons into named ContextActionGui and is parented to Class.PlayerGui.\n      The created ImageButton is parented to this ContextActionGui. GetButton\n      can be used to retrieve the button that was created.\n\n      If an input has more than one function bound to it, each function will be\n      placed on a stack. A stack obeys the principle of last in first out. So\n      the first object placed on the stack will be on the top. The next object\n      placed on the stack becomes the top and the previous object moves one\n      position down (like a stack of books). When the input is triggered, the\n      function at the top of the stack is called. If the function returns\n      Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass this will continue down the stack. To\n      remove a function from being called by all input that it was bound by use\n      Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction().\n\n      BindAction allows control over whether or not a bound action should be\n      processed by other actions on the stack using Enum.ContextActionResult.\n      If Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass is returned in the callback function,\n      every action below it in the stack (last function called gets executed\n      first) will get a chance to process it. Anything other than Pass will be\n      treated as Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink, including nil. It will also\n      sink if the callback is yielded.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: actionName\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: functionToBind\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: createTouchButton\n        type: boolean\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: inputTypes\n        type: Tuple\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This item has been superseded by Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()\n      which should be used in all new work.\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: ContextActionService:BindActivate\n    summary: |\n      Bind a Enum.KeyCode with a specific Enum.UserInputType to trigger\n      Class.Tool.Activation and Class.ClickDetector events.\n    description: |\n      Bind a Enum.KeyCode that can be used with a Enum.UserInputType to\n      activate Class.ClickDetector events, Class.Tool|Tools, and\n      Class.GuiButton|GuiButtons.
