Unlike with other mesh classes, such as\n  Class.SpecialMesh and Class.BlockMesh, they are not parented to a\n  Class.BasePart but rather behave as a Class.BasePart in their own right.\n\n  The mesh and texture of a Class.MeshPart are determined by the\n  Class.MeshPart.MeshId|MeshId and Class.MeshPart.TextureID|TextureID\n  properties. For more information, see Meshes.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - TriangleMeshPart\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: MeshPart.DoubleSided\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether to render both faces of polygons in the mesh.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether to render both faces of polygons in the\n      mesh.

To\n      do this, a new image can be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture.\n      The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh\n      using the Export Selection option in Studio. The image file will be\n      saved alongside the exported .obj file.\n\n      The new texture can then be uploaded to Roblox as a decal and its\n      asset URI can be applied\n      to the mesh using the Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent or\n      Class.MeshPart.TextureID|TextureID property.\n\n      Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent can also be set to\n      reference an Class.EditableImage that has not been published yet.\n\n\n      local AssetService = game:GetService(\"AssetService\")\n      local Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\n      local meshPart = Workspace.MeshPart\n\n      local editableImage = AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync(meshPart.TextureContent)\n      meshPart.TextureContent = Content.fromObject(editableImage)  -- Live updates\n\n\n      When Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent references an\n      Class.EditableImage, the texture will live update with any edits to the\n      Class.EditableImage object.\n\n      ##### Making a Textured Mesh\n\n      A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped, referring to\n      the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done\n      using Roblox Studio and must be done using an external 3D modeling\n      application such as Blender.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: MeshPart.TextureID\n    summary: |\n      The texture applied to the Class.MeshPart.
