Similar to\n  CFrameValue, a RayValue's stored ray cannot be viewed or edited within the\n  Properties window within studio. Instead, use the Command bar to get and set\n  the value of these objects. For example, you can use a line like the one below\n  to create a new RayValue named \"Value\" within the Class.Workspace. It\n  creates a ray at (0, 50, 0) and it faces in the positive-X direction.\n\n  Instance.new(\"RayValue\").Value = Ray.new(Vector3.new(0, 50, 0), Vector3.new(10, 0, 0))\n\n  Since there is no trivial way to edit rays within Studio, sometimes it is\n  better to use a CFrameValue instead (which can be changed through a part or\n  the camera). You can reconstruct a ray from a CFrame using\n  Ray.new(cf.p, cf.lookVector  dist), where cf is a given CFrame and dist\n  is the length of the Ray you want to construct.\n\n  Like all \"-Value\" objects, this single value is stored in the Value property.\n  The Changed event for this (and other objects like it) will fire with the new\n  value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the\n  property being changed.\ncodesamples:\n  - Rays-RayValue-and-Raycasting\ninherits:\n  - ValueBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: RayValue.Value\n    summary: |\n      The stored Ray.\n    description: |\n      The stored Ray.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Ray\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: RayValue.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fired when Class.RayValue.Value is changed.\n    description: |\n      This event fires whenever the Class.RayValue.Value property is changed.\n      It will run with the new value being stored in the argument object,\n      instead of a string representing the property being changed.\n\n      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an\n      RayValue changes and to track the different values that it may change to.\n\n      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as\n      Class.NumberValue and Class.StringValue, depending on what object type\n      best suits the need.\n    codesamples:\n      - how-to-use-rayvalue-changed\n    parameters:\n      - name: value\n        type: Ray\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The value after the change.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: RayValue.changed\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: value\n        type: Ray\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This event is a deprecated variant of Class.RayValue.Changed which\n      should be used instead.\n    security: None\n    capabilities: []\ncallbacks: []",
