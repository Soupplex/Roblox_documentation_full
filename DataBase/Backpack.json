Any Class.Tool in a\n  player's Backpack will be displayed in their inventory at the bottom of their\n  screen. Selecting Class.Tool|Tools from the inventory will equip the\n  Class.Tool, moving it from the Backpack to the player's character.\n\n  The Backpack can also store Class.Script|Scripts and\n  Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts, which run when placed in a player's\n  Backpack.\n\n  When a player's character spawns, the contents of the Class.StarterPack and\n  their Class.StarterGear are copied into their Backpack. Once a character\n  dies, the Backpack is removed and a new one will be created -- populating it\n  with the contents of Class.StarterPack and Class.StarterGear.\n\n  Roblox provides an interface for a player to access their backpack and\n  inventory by default at the bottom of the screen. If a developer wishes to\n  disable the default Roblox backpack GUI and replace it with their own, they\n  may do so using Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled().\n\n  The Backpack can be accessed from both the client and the server.\n\n  lua\n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n\n  -- Accessing Backpack from a Server Script:\n  local backpack = Players.PlayerName.Backpack\n\n  -- Accessing Backpack from a LocalScript:\n  local backpack = Players.LocalPlayer.Backpack\n\ncodesamples:\n  - Backpack-Give-Tool\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
