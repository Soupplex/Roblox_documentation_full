It is used in the\n  similarly-named Class.BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties property.\n\n  #### Weighting Behavior\n\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties also provides weightings properties,\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties.ElasticityWeight|ElasticityWeight and\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight. When two parts\n  interact, the friction and elasticity between them are determined in the same\n  way by the following pairwise weighted average function:\n\n  lua\n  local function getActualFriction(partA, partB)\n  \treturn (partA.Friction  partA.FrictionWeight + partB.Friction  partB.FrictionWeight) / (partA.FrictionWeight + partB.FrictionWeight)\n  end\n\n\n  Although the formula above refers to the\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Friction|Friction and\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight of two parts,\n  A and B, the formula is used in the same manner when determining\n  Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Elasticity|Elasticity. Generally, when the\n  weight of A is much greater than that of B, the actual value will be\n  closer to A. If the weights are similar, the actual value will be close to\n  the midpoint between their individual values.\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  - name: PhysicalProperties.new\n    summary: Returns a Datatype.PhysicalProperties with the default properties for the given material.\n    description: Returns a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container, with the density, friction, and elasticity specified for this material.\n    parameters:\n      - name: material\n        type: Material\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: PhysicalProperties.new\n    summary: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.PhysicalProperties with the specified density, friction, and\n      elasticity.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container, with the specified density,\n      friction, and elasticity.\n    parameters:\n      - name: density\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: friction\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: elasticity\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: PhysicalProperties.new\n    summary: |-\n      Creates a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container with the specified density,\n      friction, elasticity, weight of friction, and weight of elasticity.\n    description: |-\n      Creates a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container with the specified density,\n      friction, elasticity, weight of friction, and weight of elasticity.\n    parameters:\n      - name: density\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: friction\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: elasticity\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: frictionWeight\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: elasticityWeight\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: PhysicalProperties.new\n    summary: |-\n      Creates a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container with the specified density,\n      friction, elasticity, weight of friction, weight of elasticity, and acoustic absorption.\n    description: |-\n      Creates a Datatype.PhysicalProperties container with the specified density,\n      friction, elasticity, weight of friction, weight of elasticity, and acoustic absorption.\n    parameters:\n      - name: density\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: friction\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: elasticity\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: frictionWeight\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: elasticityWeight\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: acousticAbsorption\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\nconstants: []\nproperties:\n  - name: PhysicalProperties.AcousticAbsorption\n    type: number\n    summary: |\n      A value between 0 and 1 denoting how absorbent the material is to\n      Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters.\n    description: |\n      A value between 0 and 1 denoting how absorbent the material is to\n      Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters.
