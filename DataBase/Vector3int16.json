It is similar to\n  Datatype.Vector3 in that it allows for the same arithmetic operations, but\n  it lacks commonly used vector functions.\n\n  Datatype.Vector3int16 should not be confused with:\n\n  - Datatype.Vector3, a more precise and complete implementation for 3D\n    vectors.\n  - Datatype.Vector2int16, a similar implementation for 2D vectors.\n\n  For each component:\n\n  - The lower bound is -215, or -32,768.\n  - The upper bound is 215 &minus; 1, or 32,767.\n\n  #### Converting to Vector3\n\n  To convert a Datatype.Vector3int16 to a Datatype.Vector3, construct a\n  Datatype.Vector3 by passing each component of the\n  Datatype.Vector3int16 to Datatype.Vector3.new():\n\n  lua\n  local vector3int16 = Vector3int16.new(1, 2, 3)\n  local vector3 = Vector3.new(vector3int16.X, vector3int16.Y, vector3int16.Z)\n  print(vector3)  --> 1, 2, 3\n\n\n  Do not pass an entire Datatype.Vector3int16 to Datatype.Vector3.new(),\n  as the constructor interprets a Datatype.Vector3int16 as a 0 within its\n  parameters without producing an error. This can lead to silent logic\n  errors if you do something like:\n\n  lua\n  local vector3int16 = Vector3int16.new(1, 2, 3)\n  local vector3 = Vector3.new(vector3int16)\n  print(vector3)  --> 0, 0, 0\n\n\n  #### Math Operations\n\n  The following math operations are valid for the Datatype.Vector3int16 data\n  type. For all operations, be mindful of the bounds associated with signed\n  16-bit integers, described earlier.\n\n\n\n\n        Operation\n        Description\n\n\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16 + Datatype.Vector3int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the sum of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16 - Datatype.Vector3int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the difference of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16  Datatype.Vector3int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the product of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16 / Datatype.Vector3int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the quotient of the operands' respective components. The results of the\n      division are rounded down.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16  number\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the product of the respective Datatype.Vector3int16 components and the number (factor). This operation is commutative.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector3int16 / number\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector3int16 whose components are the quotient of the respective Datatype.Vector3int16 components and the number (divisor). The results of the\n      division are rounded toward zero.\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  - name: Vector3int16.new\n    summary: Returns a new Datatype.Vector3int16 from the given x, y, and z components.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a new Datatype.Vector3int16 from the given x, y and z components.\n      Non-integer components are rounded down.\n\n      The components must fall within the range [-215,\n      215).
