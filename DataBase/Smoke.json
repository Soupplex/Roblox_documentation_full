Like other particle\n  emitters of its kind, Smoke objects emit particles when parented to a\n  Class.BasePart (such as a Class.Part) or an Class.Attachment within such\n  a Class.BasePart. Compared to the Class.ParticleEmitter class, Smoke lacks\n  many different customization properties and special methods, such as\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime or Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit(). It is\n  useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it\n  is preferable to use a Class.ParticleEmitter instead.\n\n  When Class.Smoke.Enabled is toggled off, particles emit by this object will\n  continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Smoke object's\n  Class.Instance.Parent is set to nil (and/or Class.Instance:Destroy()ed),\n  all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try\n  hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Smoke after\n  a few seconds using Class.Debris to give the last particles a chance to\n  expire. This object does not have a Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear() method,\n  but it is possible to set the Class.Instance.Parent to nil and back to the\n  exact same object for the same effect.\n\n  Smoke particles are only emitted from the center of Class.BasePart to which\n  they are parented. Parenting a Smoke object to an Class.Attachment instead\n  allows customization of the particles' start position.\ncodesamples:\n  - Add-Smoke-to-Fire\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Smoke.Color\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color of the smoke particles.\n    description: |\n      The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a\n      Class.Smoke object (both existing and future particles). It behaves\n      similarly to Class.ParticleEmitter.Color, except that it is only one\n      color and not a Datatype.ColorSequence. A color of white with some\n      Class.Smoke.Opacity makes for a nice fog effect, and a very opaque black\n      color can compliment a Class.Fire object nicely.\n    codesamples:\n      - Add-Smoke-to-Fire\n    type: Color3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Smoke.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether smoke particles emit.\n    description: |\n      The Enabled property, much like Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled,\n      determines whether smoke particles are emitted. Any particles already emit\n      will continue to render until their lifetime expires. This property is\n      useful for keeping pre-made smoke effects off until they are needed later.\n      Since smoke particles are destroyed when the Class.Smoke object's\n      Class.Instance.Parent is set to nil, this property is useful in\n      allowing existing particles the opportunity to expire before destroying\n      the Fire object altogether.

It must be in\n      the range [0, 1]. This property works inversely in comparison to a\n      part's Class.BasePart.Transparency or ParticleEmitter's\n      Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency: a value of 0 is completely\n      invisible, 1 is completely visible.\n\n      The texture that Roblox uses for Class.Smoke particles is partially\n      transparent, so setting this property to 1 still yields transparency in\n      rendered smoke.\n    codesamples:\n      - Add-Smoke-to-Fire\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Smoke.RiseVelocity\n    summary: |\n      Determines the velocity of the smoke particles.\n    description: |\n      RiseVelocity behaves similarly to Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed and\n      Class.Fire.Heat: it determines how fast the smoke particles move during\n      their lifetime. It must be in the range [-25, 25]. Negative values will\n      cause particles to emit in the bottom (-Y) direction of the parent\n      Class.BasePart.\n\n      When using a Class.Smoke effect to create fog, set this property to 0.\n      For large smoke effects, make the rise subtle (2 to 8). For chimneys and\n      smokestacks, higher values are appropriate.\n    codesamples:\n      - Add-Smoke-to-Fire\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Smoke.Size\n    summary: |\n      Determines the size of newly emit smoke particles.\n    description: |\n      The Size property of Class.Smoke determines the size of the newly emit\n      smoke particles. Unlike Class.Smoke.Color, this property will not change\n      the size of existing particles. It must be in the range [0.1, 100]. Unlike\n      Class.ParticleEmitter.Size, this property is only a number (not a\n      Datatype.NumberSequence). Also note also that the size of the particles\n      is not 1-to-1 with studs; in fact, the size of the smoke particle is more\n      than twice as large. At the largest size, smoke particles can render\n      larger than 200 studs wide!\n    codesamples:\n      - Add-Smoke-to-Fire\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Smoke.TimeScale\n    summary: |\n      Value between 0-1 that controls the speed of the particle effect.\n    description: |\n      A value between 0-1 than controls the speed of the particle effect.
