Super tight\n      clothing may lead to an intersection between the clothing mesh and body\n      mesh. To solve this visual artifact, the deformer can compress the body\n      mesh slightly to solve possible intersections.\n\n      Valid range is 0 to 1. A value of 0 will compress the body mesh as much as\n      necessary to ensure that the intersections are eliminated (visible body\n      parts might look a little bit deformed). A value of 1 will prevent the\n      body mesh from being compressed (may lead to visible intersections or\n      Z-fighting). A value of 0.9 (default) is a reasonable default that solves\n      most of the intersections without introducing any significant body\n      deformation.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
