A new ForceField is created when a character spawns on\n  a Class.SpawnLocation and the Class.SpawnLocation.Duration property is\n  greater than zero.\n\n  #### Damage and Joints\n\n  A ForceField influences the instance it's parented to. When parented to a\n  Class.Model, it protects all of the Class.BasePart|BaseParts descending\n  from that model. If parented to a Class.BasePart, the part's joints will\n  only be protected if both the part and the part it's connected to also contain\n  a ForceField.\n\n  ForceField only protects Class.Humanoid|Humanoids from damage dealt by\n  the Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage() method. Humanoids can still be damaged by\n  setting Class.Humanoid.Health directly. For this reason, it's advised that\n  you use Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage() to assign damage while accounting for\n  force field protection.\n\n  #### Visualization\n\n  When Class.ForceField.Visible is set to true, a particle effect is created.\n  A number of rules determine where this effect will be emitted from:\n\n  - When parented to a Class.Model, if the model includes a Class.Humanoid\n    named Humanoid with Class.Humanoid.RigType set to R15, the effect will\n    be emitted from the part named UpperTorso. Otherwise, the effect will be\n    emitted from the part named Torso.\n  - When parented to a Class.BasePart the effect will be emitted from the\n    part's Class.BasePart.Position.\ncodesamples:\n  - ForceField-Instantiation\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ForceField.Visible\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether or not the Class.ForceField particle effect is\n      visible.\n    description: |\n      Determines whether or not the Class.ForceField particle effect is\n      visible.
