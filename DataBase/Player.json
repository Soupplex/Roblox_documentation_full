These objects are\n  added to the Class.Players service when a new player connects, then removed\n  when they eventually disconnect from the server.\n\n  The Class.Instance.Name property reflects the player's username. When saving\n  information about a player, you should use their Class.Player.UserId|UserId\n  since it is possible that a player can change their username.\n\n  There are several similar methods in the Class.Players service for working\n  with Player objects. Use these over their respective Class.Instance methods:\n\n  - You can get a table of current Player objects using\n    Class.Players:GetPlayers(); again, use this instead of\n    Class.Instance:GetChildren().\n  - To detect the addition of Player objects, it is recommended to use the\n    Class.Players.PlayerAdded event (instead of Class.Instance.ChildAdded on\n    the Class.Players service).\n  - Similarly, you can detect the removal of Player objects using\n    Class.Players.PlayerRemoving, which fires just before the Player is\n    removed (instead of Class.Instance.ChildRemoved which fires after). This\n    is important if you are saving information about the player that might be\n    removed or cleaned up on removal.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Player.AccountAge\n    summary: |\n      Describes the player's account age in days.\n    description: |\n      This property describes how long ago a player's account was registered in\n      days.
