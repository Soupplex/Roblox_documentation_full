It can be accessed from\n  Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts using the local player's\n  Class.Player:GetMouse() method. Both PlayerMouse and Class.Mouse are\n  legacy APIs, superseded by Class.UserInputService.\n\n  The only difference between the PlayerMouse and the Class.Mouse object is\n  the PlayerMouse can be obtained using the Class.Player:GetMouse() method.\n\n  In most cases developers are advised to use the new Class.UserInputService.\n  However the PlayerMouse and Mouse objects remain supported for a number of\n  reasons. See Input and Camera for more information\n  on customizing inputs in your experience.\ncodesamples:\n  - PlayerMouse\ninherits:\n  - Mouse\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
