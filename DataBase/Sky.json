This object's\n  skybox is composed of six sides, like a\n  cube. Rotation of the skybox can be changed through\n  Class.Sky.SkyboxOrientation|SkyboxOrientation.\n\n  The skybox sun, moon, and other celestial objects remain visible unless you\n  turn off the Class.Sky.CelestialBodiesShown|CelestialBodiesShown property.\n  By adjusting the Class.Sky.StarCount|StarCount property, you can change how\n  many stars appear in the sky at night.\n\n  This object can also be used as a cubemap for reflections in\n  Class.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames, in which case only the Class.Sky\n  object's six‑side Skybox[…] properties are used. For details, see\n  viewport frames.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Sky.CelestialBodiesShown\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether the sun, moon, and stars will show.\n    description: |\n      Sets whether the sun, moon, and stars will show.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      -

This property takes a\n      Datatype.Vector3 of degree values in the typical XYZ order, but\n      applies rotation first around the Y axis. After applying the Y\n      axis rotation, the orientation is applied to the X and Z axes to\n      allow for predictable control over complex movements. Your camera and\n      object orientation can affect how this rotation appears to be applied.\n\n      An easy way to script an orientation animation is to spin around the Y\n      axis (keeping the horizon level), then tilt this axis by setting X and\n      Z to a fixed value:\n\n      lua\n      local Lighting = game:GetService(\"Lighting\")\n      local RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\n      local sky = Lighting:FindFirstChild(\"Sky\")\n\n      local ROTATIONSPEED = 5  -- In degrees per second\n\n      RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(deltaTime)\n      \tsky.SkyboxOrientation = Vector3.new(\n      \t\t30,\n      \t\t(sky.SkyboxOrientation.Y + ROTATIONSPEED  deltaTime) % 360,\n      \t\t0\n      \t)\n      end)\n\n\n      See here for further info\n      and limitations.\n    codesamples:\n      - Skybox-Orientation\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Sky.SkyboxRightContent\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Sky.SkyboxRt\n    summary: |\n      Asset ID for the right surface of the skybox.\n    description: |\n      Asset ID for the right surface of the skybox.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Sky.SkyboxUp\n    summary: |\n      Asset ID for the top surface of the skybox.\n    description: |\n      Asset ID for the top surface of the skybox.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Sky.SkyboxUpContent\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\n  - name: Sky.StarCount\n    summary: |\n      How many stars are shown in the skybox.\n    description: |\n      How many stars are shown in the skybox.
