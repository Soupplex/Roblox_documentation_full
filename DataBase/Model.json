They are\n  best used to hold collections of Class.BasePart|BaseParts and have a number\n  of functions that extend their functionality.\n\n  Models are intended to represent geometric groupings. If your grouping has\n  no geometric interpretation, for instance a collection of\n  Class.Script|Scripts, use a Class.Folder instead.\n\n  Models whose constituent parts are joined together with joints (so that they\n  can move around or be destroyed via physics simulation) usually have a\n  Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart set, as it specifies which part within\n  the model the pivot and bounding box will \"follow\" as the model moves. Static\n  models which stay in one place do not benefit from having a primary part set.\n\n  Models have a wide range of applications, including Roblox player characters.\n  They also have a number of unique behaviors that are important to keep in\n  mind:\n\n  - When a Class.Humanoid and a Class.Part named Head are parented under\n    a model, a name/health GUI will appear over the model; see\n    Character Name/Health Display\n    for details.\n  - If a part's position on the Y axis hits the\n    Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight value, and it was the last object\n    inside of a Class.Model, the model will be destroyed as well.\n  - When used in a place with Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled set to true,\n    the value of Class.Model.ModelStreamingMode|ModelStreamingMode controls\n    various behaviors around how the model and any descendants are replicated\n    and/or removed from clients. In addition, the value of\n    Class.Model.LevelOfDetail|LevelOfDetail impacts rendering of the model.\n\n  As with all Class.Instance types, the fact that a parent Class.Model is\n  replicated to a client does not guarantee that all its children are\n  replicated. This is particularly important if these instances are being\n  accessed by code running on the client, such as in a Class.LocalScript.\n  Using Class.Model.ModelStreamingMode|ModelStreamingMode with values such as\n  Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Atomic can ensure that the entire model and all of\n  its descendants are present if the parent model exists on the client, or you\n  can use Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild() when atomicity is not\n  desired.\ncodesamples:\n  - Model-Instantiation\ninherits:\n  - PVInstance\ndescendants:\n  - Actor\n  - BackpackItem\n  - Status\n  - WorldRoot\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Model.LevelOfDetail\n    summary: |\n      Sets the level of detail on the model for experiences with instance\n      streaming enabled.\n    description: |\n      Sets the level of detail on the model for experiences with instance\n      streaming enabled.\n\n      When set to Enum.ModelLevelOfDetail|StreamingMesh, a lower resolution\n      \"imposter\" mesh (colored, coarse mesh that wraps around all child parts of\n      the model) renders outside the streaming radius.\n\n      When set to Enum.ModelLevelOfDetail|SLIM, a Scalable Lightweight\n      Interactive Model, or SLIM, model (a composite of all child parts of the\n      model) renders at progressively lower resolutions at distances based on\n      the streaming radius.

The primary part is the\n      Class.BasePart that acts as the physical reference for the pivot of the\n      model. That is, when parts within the model are moved due to physical\n      simulation or other means, the pivot will move in sync with the primary\n      part.\n\n      Note that Class.Model|Models do not have PrimaryPart set by default.\n      If you are creating a model that needs to be acted upon by physics, you\n      should manually set this property in Studio or within a script. If the\n      primary part is not set, the pivot will remain at the same location in\n      world space, even if parts within the model are moved.\n\n      Also note that when setting this property, it must be a Class.BasePart\n      that is a descendant of the model. If you try to set\n      Class.Model.PrimaryPart to a Class.BasePart that is not a\n      descendant of the model, it will be set to that part but reset to nil\n      during the next simulation step &mdash; this is legacy behavior to support\n      scripts which assume they can temporarily set the primary part to a\n      Class.BasePart which isn't a descendant of the model.\n\n      The general rule for models is that:\n\n      - Models whose parts are joined together via physical joints such as\n        Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints or Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds\n        should have a primary part assigned.
