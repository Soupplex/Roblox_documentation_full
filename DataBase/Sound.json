This object can be placed within a\n  Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment to emit a sound from a particular\n  position within a place or world, or it can be attached elsewhere to play the\n  sound at a constant volume throughout the entire place.\ndescription: |\n  Class.Sound is an object that emits sound. When placed in a Class.BasePart\n  or an Class.Attachment, this object will emit its sound from that part's\n  Class.BasePart.Position or the attachment's\n  Class.Attachment.WorldPosition. In this placement, a Class.Sound exhibits\n  the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch varies with the relative\n  motion of whatever attachment or part it is attached to. Additionally, its\n  volume will be determined by the distance between the client's sound listener\n  (by default the Class.Camera position) and the position of the sound's\n  parent. For more information, see Class.Sound.RollOffMode|RollOffMode.\n\n  A sound is considered \"global\" if it is not parented to a Class.BasePart\n  or an Class.Attachment. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume\n  throughout the entire place.\ncodesamples:\n  - Sound-3D-Parent\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Sound.AudioContent\n    summary: |\n      A reference to an audio asset.\n    description: |\n      This property is a reference to an audio asset.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Asset\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - LegacySound\n  - name: Sound.EmitterSize\n    summary: |\n      The minimum distance, in studs, at which a 3D Class.Sound (direct child\n      of a Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment) will begin to attenuate\n      (decrease in volume).\n    description: |\n      The minimum distance, in studs, at which a 3D Class.Sound (direct child\n      of a Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment) will begin to attenuate\n      (decrease in volume).\n\n      Sounds parented to a Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment that are\n      descendants of the Class.Workspace are considered 3D sounds and their\n      volume while playing is dependent on the distance between the client's\n      sound listener (Class.Camera position by default) and the Sound's\n      parent.
