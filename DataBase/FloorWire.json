It sometimes goes through bricks but the majority of the\n  time it works fine. It starts at From's center and goes to To's center. Which\n  side of each one it goes into depends on the BaseParts's positions. It chooses\n  the fastest route.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiBase3d\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new work.\nproperties:\n  - name: FloorWire.CycleOffset\n    summary: |\n      A decimal number between 0 and 1, through which you can control how far\n      all of the decals are along the wire.\n    description: |\n      A decimal number between 0 and 1, through which you can control how far\n      all of the decals are along the wire.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.From\n    summary: |\n      The object that the FloorWire travels from.\n    description: |\n      The object that the FloorWire travels from.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: BasePart\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.StudsBetweenTextures\n    summary: |\n      The number of studs between each FloorWire segment.\n    description: |\n      The number of studs between each FloorWire segment.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.Texture\n    summary: |\n      Sets the texture to be displayed on the FloorWire.\n    description: |\n      Sets the texture to be displayed on the FloorWire.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.TextureSize\n    summary: |\n      Sets the size of the texture used with the FloorWire.\n    description: |\n      Sets the size of the texture used with the FloorWire.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector2\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.To\n    summary: |\n      The object that the FloorWire travels to.\n    description: |\n      The object that the FloorWire travels to.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: BasePart\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.Velocity\n    summary: |\n      The speed that the textures flow along the wire.\n    description: |\n      The speed that the textures flow along the wire.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: FloorWire.WireRadius\n    summary: |\n      The radius of the wire.\n    description: |\n      The radius of the wire.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      The FloorWire object has been deprecated and should not be used in new\n      work.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
