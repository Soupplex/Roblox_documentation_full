A Class.ScreenGui only shows if parented to\n  a player's Class.PlayerGui; parenting a Class.ScreenGui to\n  Class.StarterGui ensures it clones into each player's Class.PlayerGui when\n  they join the experience and their character first spawns. See\n  On‑Screen UI Containers for further\n  details.\n\n\n\n  For performance improvements, the appearance of a Class.ScreenGui is cached\n  until one of the following events occurs:\n\n  - A descendant is added to or removed from it.\n  - A property of a descendant changes.\n  - A property of the Class.ScreenGui itself changes.\n\n  If any of these events occur, the Class.ScreenGui appearance is recomputed\n  on the next frame it gets rendered.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - LayerCollector\ndescendants:\n  - GuiMain\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ScreenGui.ClipToDeviceSafeArea\n    summary: |\n      Whether to clip the contents of this Class.ScreenGui to the device's\n      safe area.\n    description: |\n      If this property is true, all Class.GuiObject descendants of the\n      Class.ScreenGui will be clipped to the device's safe area (see\n      Enum.ScreenInsets). The default is true to maintain backwards\n      compatibility of UI that is intentionally hidden offscreen, such as\n      objects that slide into view from a screen edge when they're needed.\n\n\n\n      If this property is false, Class.GuiObject descendants will not be\n      clipped to the device's safe area and may be obscured by the camera notch\n      or other screen cutouts.\n\n\n\n      Note that this property will be ignored if you set\n      Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets to Enum.ScreenInsets|None,\n      as doing so implies that you intentionally want to disregard the device's\n      safe insets.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: ScreenGui.DisplayOrder\n    summary: |\n      Controls the Z-index order in which multiple Class.ScreenGui containers\n      are drawn.\n    description: |\n      This property controls the Z-index order in which multiple\n      Class.ScreenGui containers are drawn.

Eligibility occurs if\n      the total area of the descendant Class.GuiObject (including any applied\n      border or Class.UIStroke) covers the device's safe area both\n      horizontally and vertically. See the Enum.SafeAreaCompatibility enum\n      reference for details.\n\n      The default value is Enum.SafeAreaCompatibility|FullscreenExtension in\n      order to automatically improve the appearance of UI that was authored for\n      screens without any cutouts. However, it's recommended that you avoid\n      fullscreen extensions for new work; instead, use the\n      Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets property to specify which\n      insets should be respected for different Class.ScreenGui containers.\n\n      Note that descendant UI objects will continue to be clipped by the\n      device's safe area if\n      Class.ScreenGui.ClipToDeviceSafeArea|ClipToDeviceSafeArea is set to\n      true.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: SafeAreaCompatibility\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: ScreenGui.ScreenInsets\n    summary: |\n      Controls the safe area insets that are applied to the contents of the\n      Class.ScreenGui.\n    description: |\n      This property controls the safe area insets that are applied to the\n      contents of the Class.ScreenGui.\n\n      The default of Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets keeps all descendant\n      Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects inside the core UI safe area, clear of the\n      Roblox top bar buttons and other screen cutouts like the device's camera\n      notch.\n\n\n\n      If you set this property to Enum.ScreenInsets|None, UI objects may be\n      obscured behind core UI objects or device cutouts like the camera notch.\n      As a result, you should only use Enum.ScreenInsets|None for a\n      Class.ScreenGui that contains noninteractive content like background\n      images.\n\n      See\n      On-Screen UI Containers\n      for alternative examples.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ScreenInsets\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
