A queue is a data structure\n  that provides temporary storage for arbitrary items (up to the maximum item\n  size -- see\n  MemoryStore Limits).\n  Each queue item has a numeric priority: MemoryStore retrieves items with\n  higher priority from the queue first, and it retrieves Items with the same\n  priority in order of addition.\n\n  Items in the queue can optionally be set to expire after a certain amount of\n  time. Expired items simply disappear from the queue as if they were never\n  added.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: MemoryStoreQueue:AddAsync\n    summary: |\n      Adds an item to the queue.\n    description: |\n      Adds an item to the queue.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: value\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The value of the item to add to the queue.\n      - name: expiration\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Item expiration time, in seconds, after which the item will be\n          automatically removed from the queue.\n      - name: priority\n        type: double\n        default: 0\n        summary: |\n          Item priority.
