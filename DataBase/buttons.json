You can customize buttons to provide context and feedback, such as changing the visual appearance or scripting audible feedback when a user clicks a button.\\n\\nThere are two types of buttons which you can place on‑screen or in‑experience:\\n\\n- A Class.TextButton is a rectangle with text that triggers the Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated event on click/tap.\\n\\n- An Class.ImageButton is a rectangle with an image that triggers the Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated event on click/tap. It features additional states for swapping the image on user hover or press.\\n\\nCreate buttons on the screen\\n\\nButtons on a screen are useful to quickly guide users to various menus or pages.\\n\\nTo add a button to the screen:\\n\\n1. In the Explorer window, select StarterGui and add a ScreenGui.\\n\\n   1. Hover over StarterGui and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\\n\\n   1. Insert a ScreenGui.\\n\\n2. Select the new ScreenGui and add a button.\\n\\n   1. Hover over ScreenGui and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\\n\\n   1. Insert either a TextButton or ImageButton.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate buttons on part faces\\n\\nButtons on a part are useful for allowing users to interact with parts. For\\nexample, you can let users step on a button to complete an action.\\n\\nTo add a button to the face of a part:\\n\\n1. In the Explorer window, select the part and add a SurfaceGui.\\n\\n   1. Hover over the part and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\\n\\n   1. Insert a SurfaceGui.\\n\\n2. Select the new SurfaceGui and add any type of button or input.\\n\\n   1. Hover over SurfaceGui and click the &CirclePlus; button. A contextual menu displays.\\n\\n   1. Insert either a TextButton or\\n      ImageButton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   If you don't see the button, try choosing a different face in the Face property of the SurfaceGui.\\n\\n\\nChange the appearance of an ImageButton\\n\\nChanging the appearance of an Class.ImageButton when a user is interacting with it provides useful visual feedback. For example, when an Class.ImageButton changes visual appearance when a user hovers over it, it lets the user know that it isn't disabled and that they have the option to click it if they want to perform that Class.ImageButton action.\\n\\nAn Class.ImageButton has three properties to change its visual appearance:\\n\\n- Class.ImageButton.Image|Image - The image that displays when a user is not interacting with the Class.ImageButton.\\n\\n- Class.ImageButton.HoverImage|HoverImage - The image that displays when a user is hovering their cursor over the Class.ImageButton.\\n\\n- Class.ImageButton.PressedImage|PressedImage - The image that displays when a user is clicking the Class.ImageButton.\\n\\n\\n\\n    Normal\\n\\n\\n\\n    Hover\\n\\n\\n\\n    Pressed\\n\\n\\nTo change the appearance of an Class.ImageButton with user input:\\n\\n1. Add an ImageButton to a screen or a surface.\\n\\n2. In the Explorer window, click the ImageButton object.\\n\\n3. In the Properties window, assign three different respective asset IDs for the Image, HoverImage, and PressedImage properties.\\n\\nScript buttons\\n\\nYou can script an action when a user presses a button by connecting the button to a Class.GuiButton.Activated event. For example, when you parent the following Class.LocalScript to a button, the button changes to a random color every time a user clicks it.\\n\\nlua\\nlocal button = script.Parent\\nlocal RNG = Random.new()\\nlocal function onButtonActivated()\\n\\t-- randomize the button color\\n\\tbutton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromHSV(RNG:NextNumber(), 1, 1)\\nend\\nbutton.Activated:Connect(onButtonActivated)\",\n    \"source\": \"buttons.md\"\n}",
