The\\n  Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position property, not to be confused with\\n  Class.BasePart.Position, controls the target world position. This is the\\n  translational counterpart to a Class.BodyGyro.\\n\\n  If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a\\n  Class.BodyForce or Class.BodyThrust instead.\\n\\n  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several\\n  factors, namely the distance to the goal position: the force is stronger when\\n  farther away from the goal. This is amplified by Class.BodyPosition.P|P\\n  (power). The present velocity will also dampen the force applied by this\\n  object, and this is amplified by Class.BodyPosition.D|D (dampening). The\\n  resulting force is then capped by Class.BodyPosition.MaxForce|MaxForce. Note\\n  the force applied on the assembly to achieve the goal position may vary on a\\n  per-axis basis.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.

When\\n      the assembly approaches the goal position it needs to decelerate,\\n      otherwise it will move past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate\\n      back toward the goal. This is often creates an undesirable\\n      \\\"rubber‑banding\\\" effect, avoided by applying dampening. The higher this\\n      value is set, the greater the dampening curve becomes, or the slower the\\n      assembly will approach the goal position.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Goals\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Physics\\n  - name: BodyPosition.MaxForce\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the limit on how much force that may be applied to each axis.\\n    description: |\\n      This property determines the limit on the amount of force that may be\\n      applied on each axis in reaching the goal\\n      Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position.
