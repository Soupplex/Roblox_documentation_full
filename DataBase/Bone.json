Bones are\n  part of a Class.Model or Class.MeshPart object's skeletal rig that you\n  typically access and animate through the\n  Animation Editor.\n\n  Rigs are created during the modeling process in third-party software such as\n  Blender or Maya. After importing the rigged model into Studio, you can add the\n  model directly to your experience, or save and share the model as an asset.\n  See Rigging for more details on creating\n  and using rigged models.\n\n  Note that you can parent Class.Bone|Bones under other Class.Bone|Bones and\n  parts. When parenting a bone to another bone, the child bone's world position\n  will be relative to the parent bone's position, and the hierarchy of parented\n  Class.Bone objects can change the behavior of affected parts during posing\n  or animation.\n\n  ##### Relationship with Motor6D\n\n  To support animations with older rigs using joints, such as Class.Motor6D,\n  you can use the Class.Bone.Transform property in the same way as\n  Class.Motor6D.Transform. Roblox uses the offset of the bones from the\n  default pose to drive an animation, and bones are not replicated or\n  serialized.\n\n  ##### Bone.CFrame\n\n  Bones inherit the Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame property of\n  Class.Attachment|Attachments which Roblox uses as the bone's reference\n  position. The inherited Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame and other\n  world properties return the initial un-transformed position.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Attachment\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Bone.Transform\n    summary: |\n      Determines the current animated offset of the bone in its local space.\n    description: |\n      Transform determines the current animated offset of the bone relative\n      to its Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame. This property is set by Roblox\n      when animations on skinned meshes are played, although it can be\n      manipulated manually in a manner similar to Class.Motor6D.Transform.\n\n      See also:\n\n      - Class.Motor6D.Transform, a property which plays a similar role in\n        character rig animation\n      - Class.Bone.TransformedCFrame|TransformedCFrame and\n        Class.Bone.TransformedWorldCFrame|TransformedWorldCFrame, whose values\n        are partially determined by this property\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Transform\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - Animation\n  - name: Bone.TransformedCFrame\n    summary: |\n      Describes the combined Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame offset of the bone\n      and the current animation offset in the bone local space.\n    description: |\n      TransformedCFrame describes the combined\n      Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame offset of the bone and the current\n      animation offset (Class.Bone.Transform|Transform) in the bone's local\n      space.\n\n      See also:\n\n      - Class.Bone.Transform|Transform, a property which partially determines\n        this property's value\n      - Class.Bone.TransformedWorldCFrame, a world-space variant of this\n        property\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Derived Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - Animation\n  - name: Bone.TransformedWorldCFrame\n    summary: |\n      Describes the combined Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame offset of the bone\n      and the current animation offset in world space.\n    description: |\n      TransformedWorldCFrame describes the combined\n      Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame offset of the bone and the current\n      animation offset (Class.Bone.Transform|Transform) in world space.\n\n      See also:\n\n      - Class.Bone.Transform|Transform, a property which partially determines\n        this property's value\n      - Class.Bone.TransformedCFrame, a local-space variant of this property\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    category: Derived World Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - Animation\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
