It's unlikely that one person has all of these skills, which makes collaboration between different roles an essential part of the development workflow.\\n\\nWith Studio's built-in collaboration tools, creators can contribute to experiences independently on their own time, or work together with their team all at the same time.\\n\\nManage collaborators\\n\\nCollaborators you add to an experience have permission settings that correspond to their level of access to the experience. As follows are the different user permission settings:\\n\\n\\n\\n      Permission\\n      Description\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Owner\\n      User is the owner of the experience and has permission to configure other users' permissions.\\n\\n\\n      Edit\\n      User has permission to edit the experience. This also grants the user Play permission.\\n\\n\\n      Play\\n      User has permission to play the experience privately.\\n\\n\\n      No Access\\n      User does not have either Edit or Play permissions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are some small differences when managing collaborators in group‑owned experiences vs. user‑owned experiences.\\n\\nGroup-owned experiences\\n\\nFor group experiences, only the group owner or members with sufficient permissions can manage the group's roles, either across all group experiences or on a per‑experience basis. Such users can also add individual collaborators to group‑owned experiences in the same workflow as user‑owned experiences, but only for Play access.\\n\\nIf you're the group owner or a member with sufficient permissions, you can configure collaboration across all group experiences, for example grant Edit permission to an \\\"Audio Artist\\\" group role so they can fine-tune audio playback across multiple group experiences.\\n\\n1. From the Creator Dashboard, expand the account switcher in the upper‑left and select the group.\\n1. Expand the account switcher again, select Settings under the group's name, then select Roles.\\n1. Enable Edit all group experiences for roles that should have editing permission. Remember to click Save Changes for each role that you change.\\n\\n   In Studio's Manage Collaborators window for any group-owned experience, eligible roles display Edit permission but are muted to indicate that you can't change the permission level from Studio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you're the group's owner, you can grant permissions on a per-experience basis to roles that do not have those permissions across all group experiences. For example, you can temporarily grant Edit permission to an \\\"FX Artist\\\" group role so they can fine-tune visual effects before an experience's public release.\\n\\n1. In Studio's Manage Collaborators window for any group-owned experience, select Edit from the permissions dropdown for the desired roles. Remember that you can only modify roles that do not already have edit permission across all group experiences.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Click Save for your collaboration settings to take effect. All group members within the modified roles should now have Edit permission for this experience only; this action won't grant them equal permission to other group experiences.\\n\\nUser-owned experiences\\n\\nFor user-owned experiences, you can grant Play access to any user or group, but you can only grant Edit permission to Roblox connections.\\n\\nTo give Edit permission to a connection for an experience that you own:\\n\\n1. With the experience open in Studio, click the Collaborate button on the right side of the mezzanine bar.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Type into the search bar at the top to search for a collaborator to add. A dropdown appears listing matching collaborators, with connections indicated by the Connection label. Select the collaborator to add.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Select Edit from the permissions dropdown for the connection, then click Save for your collaboration settings to take effect.\\n\\nAccess a session\\n\\nThose who have permission to edit an experience can join a collaborative session as follows:\\n\\n1. Navigate to the Creator Dashboard.\\n1. Locate the experience depending on whether it's group-owned or user-owned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   1. Select the group from the upper‑left selector menu.\\n   2. Make sure Creations is selected on the left and My Experiences in the main panel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   1. Select your personal account from the upper‑left selector menu.\\n   2. Make sure Creations is selected on the left and Shared With Me in the main panel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Hover over the experience's tile and click the Edit in Studio button to collaborate.\\n\\n\\n\\nView collaborators\\n\\nWhile working in a collaborative session, you can see the current collaborators in the upper-right corner of Studio, each with a unique assigned color that's consistent across all collaborators' devices.\\n\\nTo view more details on the current collaborators, click on any of the icons to open the Live Collaborators window. In this window, you can see whether a user is active or inactive inside Studio, as well as an indication of where the user is working. Users become inactive if they do not use Studio for more than 5 minutes.\\n\\nSelection visualization\\n\\nBy default, selected code in the Script Editor and selected objects in the 3D viewport are highlighted with the unique color assigned to each collaborator. Additionally, the Explorer window marks selected objects with dots in these assigned colors to indicate selection by other collaborators.\\n\\nTo make all collaborators' selections invisible to only you while still seeing their work, uncheck Show collaborator selections at the bottom of the Live Collaborators window.\\n\\nJoin collaborators\\n\\nTo quickly jump to a location in the workspace or to the exact line in a script that a collaborator is editing, hover over their name in the Live Collaborators window and click Join.\\n\\nComments\\n\\nRoblox Studio has a comments feature that lets you pinpoint an object in the 3D viewport and start a conversation with your collaborators, leave to-do notes, and more. Comments update in real time which lets you and your team receive and respond to feedback without disrupting your workflow in Studio. You can also receive personalized notifications to help you stay on top of feedback, even when you're not using Studio.\\n\\nWorkflow\\n\\nTo create a comment, click the Comment button on the right side of Studio's mezzanine (keyboard shortcut C).\\n\\nIn the viewport, your cursor turns blue. Click on any object that inherits from Class.BasePart (most do, including Class.Terrain), type your comment, and click Submit.\\n\\nTo tag a collaborator in your comment, use the @username syntax. You can tag any collaborator in the group for a group‑owned experience or any user with Play or Edit permissions in a user‑owned experience.\\n\\nComments appear in the Comments window, accessible from Studio's Window ⟩ Collaboration menu, with the most recent comments at the top. From within the Comments window, you can:\\n\\n- Single-click on a comment to show the full conversation in the 3D viewport.\\n- Double-click on a comment to zoom in on it in the viewport.\\n- Use the &ctdot; menu in the upper-right corner to show resolved comments, filter for only the comments that you've been tagged in, or hide comments in the viewport.\\n- Resolve comments as you and your team address them. After you resolve a comment, it disappears from both the viewport and the main list, but it isn't completely gone; you can always un‑resolve it later.\\n\\nNotifications\\n\\nTo help you stay on top of feedback even when you're not using Studio, you'll receive an email digest that recaps all recent activity. Each email digest provides a simple overview of comment activity per place, including:\\n\\n- When someone mentions (tags) you in a comment, for example @username.\\n- When someone comments in a thread that you previously replied to or were mentioned in.\\n- When someone resolves a thread that you previously replied to or were mentioned in.\\n\\nFrom within the email overview, simply click View in Studio to go directly to the conversation in Roblox Studio.\\n\\nYou're always in control of both the type and source of comments which make up email digests. Mentions and reply notifications are on by default, while resolution notifications are off. You can also unsubscribe from a specific place or thread if you don't need updates.\\n\\nCollaborative scripting\\n\\nIn a collaborative session, you can code together in real time through live scripting, or you can draft scripts in a more focused environment before committing them to a collaborator-shared repository.\\n\\nLive scripting\\n\\nLive Scripting lets collaborators code together in real time. In the Script Editor, each collaborator's cursor color matches their assigned color in the Live Collaborators window.\\n\\nWhile live scripting, edits are auto‑saved every 5 minutes just like place edits, and a collaborator can manually save a script at any time with CtrlS (⌘S). Saved or auto‑saved versions are logged in the Script History window.\\n\\nLive Scripting is enabled by default. If you and your team prefer to collaborate on scripts in an environment similar to source control, explore Drafts mode.\\n\\nDrafts mode\\n\\nThrough Drafts mode, you can independently edit and test scripts without affecting the experience for others. After you finish drafting a script, you can commit it to the shared repository and use collaborative testing to test the committed version with others.\\n\\nDrafts Mode is disabled by default. To enable it, open Studio's File ⟩ Experience Settings window, select the Other tab, and turn on Enable Drafts Mode.\\n\\nNote that all collaborators will need to exit the session for the change to take effect. Alternatively, you can disable collaboration and then reenable it to restart the session.\\n\\nCommit drafts\\n\\nOnce you've edited a script, it appears in the Drafts window, a non‑default window which you must add to a custom tab in Studio's toolbar.\\n\\nDrafts are saved to your local file system and persist between Studio sessions on the same machine. To commit your local edits to the repository, left-click a script, or hold Shift and left-click to select multiple scripts. Then click Commit to commit all selected scripts.\\n\\nCompare and merge changes\\n\\nIf another collaborator commits changes to the same script that you're editing, an icon with a green &CirclePlus; symbol appears in the Drafts window. To view their changes, right‑click the script and select Compare With Server.\\n\\nIn the (Diff) tab that opens in the Script Editor, code that other collaborators changed or deleted appears in red, while code that you updated appears in green.\\n\\nTo merge their changes into your script:\\n\\n1. In the Drafts window, right‑click the script and select Merge From Server.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. In the merge window, you can pick which code to keep, or make manual edits.\\n\\n   - Check Draft to keep your changes, or leave it unchecked to discard them.\\n   - Check Server to merge the committed changes into your draft, or leave it unchecked to ignore them.\\n   - Check Other to manually edit the script and save the changes to your draft.\\n\\n1. Once you've previewed the merge resolution, click Merge All to update your local script.\\n\\nRestore deleted scripts\\n\\nIf a collaborator deletes a script that you're editing, an icon with a red &#8856; symbol appears in the Drafts window. To restore the script, right‑click it and select Restore Script. Scripts are restored to the place's Workspace tree, so you may need to manually re‑parent them back to their original location.\\n\\nView script history\\n\\nAll script changes, whether saved by a collaborator, auto-saved, or committed by a collaborator through Drafts mode, are logged in the Version History window. To access it:\\n\\n1. Right-click the script in the Explorer window and select View Script History.\\n2. In the Version History window that opens, you'll see all committed versions of the script, the commit date, which collaborator committed, and more. From this window, the following actions are possible:\\n\\n\\n\\n   To compare any version (except the oldest) with its previous version, select it and click Compare With Previous Version. In the (Diff) tab that opens in the Script Editor, code from the newer version appears in green while code from the older version appears in red.\\n\\n\\n   To compare any two versions, hold Ctrl or ⌘ and select both, then click Compare Selected Versions. In the (Diff) tab that opens in the Script Editor, code from the newer version appears in green while code from the older version appears in red.\\n\\n\\n   If the version Comment indicates just one script was committed, select it and click Open Script to open it in the Script Editor.\\n\\n   If the version Comment indicates more than one script was committed (commonly the result of an auto‑save on multiple unsaved scripts), you can click Show within the version's row to open a popup displaying the script(s) and their respective version. Then, from the version history window, click Open All Scripts From Batch to open them in the Script Editor.\\n\\n\\n\\nSave and publish\\n\\nDuring a collaborative session, Studio automatically saves the project to the cloud every four minutes.\\n\\nRevert to previous versions\\n\\nThe owner of an experience can revert changes made by other editors. See here for instructions.\\n\\nBe careful when reverting changes. If anyone is currently editing the experience in a collaborative session, their changes may still auto‑save and overwrite the revert action. To ensure that nobody else is editing the place when you revert, disable collaboration.\\n\\nYou might also want to check Activity History. This view provides a chronological event log that improves team visibility into key experience settings.\\n\\nDisable collaboration\\n\\nTeam Create is the core Studio feature that enables collaboration. Workflows that involve the Manage Collaborators dialog will automatically enable the feature, but you can manually disable it if necessary.\\n\\n1. If the Live Collaborators window isn't already open, click on any of the collaborator icons to open it.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. In the bottom-right corner of the window, click the &ctdot; button and select Disable Team Create.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. When prompted, confirm ending the session to reload the place in a non‑collaborative state.\",\n    \"source\": \"collaboration.md\"\n}",
