The joint will attempt to rotate the two parts until a desired\n  rotational position is reached. This object is most commonly created by the\n  Enum.SurfaceType.SteppingMotor on a Class.BasePart. If created through a\n  script, behavior is still governed by the surface input of\n  Class.JointInstance.Part0.\n\n  The three inputs of note are as follows:\n\n  - NoInput &mdash; The joint will not rotate under its own power. It can\n    still be rotated by external forces (such as from a character pushing one of\n    the parts).\n\n  - Constant &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the ParamB property of\n    Class.JointInstance.Part0. This rotation is measured in radians per\n    physics frame (which is approximately 1/60th of a second).\n\n  - Sin &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the ParamA and ParamB\n    properties of Class.JointInstance.Part0.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - DynamicRotate\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  This class works alongside the deprecated Enum.SurfaceType and should not be\n  used for future work; use Class.HingeConstraint instead.\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
