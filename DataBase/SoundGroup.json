Every sound in the sound group will have its\n  volume adjusted by the group's Class.SoundGroup.Volume|Volume property which\n  acts as a multiplier, meaning a Class.Sound with volume 0.5 assigned to a\n  Class.SoundGroup with a volume of 0.5 will have an effective volume of\n  0.25.\n\n  If the Class.SoundGroup has any Class.SoundEffect|SoundEffects as\n  children, those effects will be applied to all of the Class.Sound|Sounds in\n  the group.\n\n  Note that a Class.Sound must be added to a Class.SoundGroup by setting its\n  Class.Sound.SoundGroup|SoundGroup property, not by simply parenting the\n  Class.Sound to the Class.SoundGroup. A Class.Sound can only belong to\n  one Class.SoundGroup at a time, although you can nest groups as outlined\n  here.\n\n  See Sound Groups for further details on working\n  with the Class.SoundGroup class.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SoundGroup.Volume\n    summary: |\n      The volume multiplier applied to Class.Sound|Sounds that are in the\n      Class.SoundGroup.\n    description: |\n      The volume multiplier applied to Class.Sound|Sounds which belong to the\n      Class.SoundGroup.
