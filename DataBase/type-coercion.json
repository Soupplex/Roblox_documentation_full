    "description": "Type coercion in Luau allows for arithmetic, concatenation, and assignment of differently typed values.",
    "content": "If Luau tries to use a value or variable in an operation, such as arithmetic, concatenation, or assignment, but the value isn't the type that the operation expects, then Luau converts (coerces) the value to change its data type. Coercion happens at run time for that operation and doesn't change the value of a variable.\n\nArithmetic\n\nLuau coerces strings to numbers in arithmetic operations. This behavior is built into Luau. If the types are incompatible for arithmetic, Luau throws an error and doesn't run the rest of the script. For example, you can't add a string to a number if the string does not represent a number.\n\nlua\nprint(100 + \"7\") -- 107\nprint(100 - \"7\") -- 93\nprint(\"1000\" + 234) -- 1234\nprint(\"1000\" - 234) -- 766\nprint(\"hello\" + 234) -- error: attempt to perform arithmetic (add) string and number\n\nConcatenation\n\nIn concatenation, Luau coerces numbers to strings. To convert a number to a string without using coercion, use the Library.string.format() function.\n\nlua\nprint(\"Pi is \" .. math.pi) --> Pi is 3.1415926535898\nprint(\"Pi is \" .. 3.1415927) --> Pi is 3.1415927\n\n-- Rounds to three decimal places\nprint(\"Pi is \" .. string.format(\"%.3f\", 3.1415927)) -- Pi is 3.142\n\nAssignment\n\nSome properties expect certain data types, such as an Enum or string, but you can assign a value of a different type to it and Luau converts the value to the type the property expects.\n\nEnums\n\nLuau coerces numbers and strings of enum values into the full enum name. For example, you can name the value of the Class.Part.Material property using a number, string, or full enum name, and the print() function always prints the full enum name. It's best practice to be explicit and use the full enum name. For more information on Enums, see Enums.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal part1 = Instance.new(\"Part\")\npart1.Material = 816\npart1.Parent = Workspace\nprint(part1.Material) -- Enum.Material.Concrete\n\nlocal part2 = Instance.new(\"Part\")\npart2.Material = \"Concrete\"\npart2.Parent = Workspace\nprint(part2.Material) -- Enum.Material.Concrete\n\n-- This is best practice because it's the most explicit\nlocal part3 = Instance.new(\"Part\")\npart3.Material = Enum.Material.Concrete\npart3.Parent = Workspace\nprint(part3.Material) -- Enum.Material.Concrete\n\nTime of day\n\nThe Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay property, which defines whether it is night, day, or any other time, is a string representation of the Datatype.DateTime data type. If you assign a number to Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay, Luau converts it to the string representation of Datatype.DateTime.\n\nlua\nlocal Lighting = game:GetService(\"Lighting\")\n\nLighting.TimeOfDay = \"05:00:00\"\nprint(Lighting.TimeOfDay) -- 05:00:00\n\nLighting.TimeOfDay = 5\nprint(Lighting.TimeOfDay) -- 05:00:00",
