It includes a number of\n  functions that are useful when working with Class.Animation|Animations.\n\n  A Class.KeyframeSequence stores a series of Class.Pose|Poses that encode\n  the hierarchy and motion of an animation. The animation data Roblox uses in\n  the playback of an animation, referenced by the Class.Animation.AnimationId\n  property, can be constructed from a Class.KeyframeSequence.\n  Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences are usually created by the Roblox\n  Animation Editor but can be created through\n  other plugins or even manually.\ncodesamples:\n  - KeyframeSequenceProvider-RegisterKeyframeSequence\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  This service is deprecated and does not support the newer\n  Class.AnimationClip.
