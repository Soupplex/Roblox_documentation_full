If a PointLight is parented to an\n  attachment, then the light will emanate from the attachment's\n  Class.Attachment.WorldPosition.\n\n  For more light types, see the see also section.\n\n  ## See Also\n\n  - Class.SurfaceLight\n  - Class.SpotLight\ncodesamples:\n  - pointlight\ninherits:\n  - Light\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PointLight.Range\n    summary: |\n      The size of the area that the PointLight will illuminate.\n    description: |\n      The size of the area that the PointLight will illuminate.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
