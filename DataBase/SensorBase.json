This data is\n  presented in the sensor's \"output\" property category. Often, other systems\n  will consume the sensor's output data.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - AtmosphereSensor\n  - BuoyancySensor\n  - ControllerSensor\n  - FluidForceSensor\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SensorBase.UpdateType\n    summary: |\n      Determines how the sensor will update its output data.\n    description: |\n      Determines how the sensor will update its output data.\n\n      With Enum.SensorUpdateType.OnRead, internal sensor logic is run so that\n      the output properties are always up to date. In this mode, the sensor will\n      only run if you read the properties and they are currently outdated.\n\n      With Enum.SensorUpdateType.Manual, the output properties will never\n      change. Instead, you can write your own scripts to set the output\n      properties as you like.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: SensorUpdateType\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Settings\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods:\n  - name: SensorBase:Sense\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This method should not be used in new work.\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\nevents:\n  - name: SensorBase.OnSensorOutputChanged\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities: []\ncallbacks: []",
