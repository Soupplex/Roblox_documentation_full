It can\n      be found by pasting the website URL of the t-shirt into the Graphic\n      property of the Class.ShirtGraphic in Roblox Studio, as Studio will\n      correct it. Alternatively Class.InsertService:LoadAsset() can be used to\n      insert the t-shirt into the workspace, for example:\n\n\n      local InsertService = game:GetService(\"InsertService\")\n      local Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\n      local webURL = \"https://www.roblox.com/catalog/2591161/Sword-Fight-on-the-Heights-Ring-of-Fire-T-Shirt\"\n      local assetId = tonumber(string.match(webURL, \"%d+\") or 0)  -- Extract the number\n\n      local success, model = pcall(function()\n      \treturn InsertService:LoadAsset(assetId)\n      end)\n\n      if success then\n      \tmodel.Parent = Workspace\n      end\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
