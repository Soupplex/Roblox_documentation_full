Although such game passes still have an asset ID, they now also have\n      a pass ID. All new game passes created only have a pass ID.\n\n      Whether you are using an Asset ID or a pass ID determines which\n      API members you can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Asset ID (Legacy)\n                  Pass ID (Current)\n\n\n\n\n                  Verify Ownership\n                  Class.GamePassService:PlayerHasPass()\n                  Class.MarketplaceService:UserOwnsGamePassAsync()\n\n\n                  Prompt a purchase\n                  Class.MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase()\n                  Class.MarketplaceService:PromptGamePassPurchase()\n\n\n                  Prompted purchase finished\n                  Class.MarketplaceService.PromptPurchaseFinished\n                  Class.MarketplaceService.PromptGamePassPurchaseFinished\n\n\n\n    codesamples:\n      - GamePassService-PlayerHasPass1\n    parameters:\n      - name: player\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player for which to check ownership.\n      - name: gamePassId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Asset ID of the game pass.
