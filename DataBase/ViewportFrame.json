This object has the following caveats:\n\n  - No shadows or\n    post-processing effects\n    are rendered.\n\n  - Enum.Material.Neon and Enum.Material.Glass materials render at the\n    lowest quality.\n\n  - Nested Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects aren't supported.\n\n  - By default, lighting inside a ViewportFrame acts as if\n    Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale and\n    Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale are both set to 0, so properties\n    that rely on these fields, such as Class.SurfaceAppearance.MetalnessMap,\n    may look different.\n\n  - This object can use a Class.Sky child as a cubemap for reflections, in\n    which case only the Class.Sky object's six Skybox[…] properties are\n    used. Assuming these properties are valid, lighting inside the\n    ViewportFrame acts similarly to if\n    Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale and\n    Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale are both set to 1. For details,\n    see here.\ncodesamples:\n  - viewportframe---create-gui\n  - viewportframe---control-camera\ninherits:\n  - GuiObject\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ViewportFrame.Ambient\n    summary: |\n      The lighting hue applied to the area within the ViewportFrame.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the lighting hue applied to the area within the\n      ViewportFrame.

When you set\n      this property, Class.Camera.CFrame and Class.Camera.FieldOfView will\n      be saved and replicate with the ViewportFrame internally so the client\n      can render the frame without a Class.Camera object.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Camera\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: ViewportFrame.ImageColor3\n    summary: |\n      Determines how the rendered viewport image will be colorized.\n    description: |\n      This property determines how the rendered viewport image will be\n      colorized, allowing you to change the color without directly modifying the\n      rendered object.
