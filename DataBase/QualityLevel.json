Higher levels correspond to higher\n  quality graphics.\n\n  As QualityLevel increases, Roblox rendering engine increases the rendering\n  distance, shading quality, apparent geometry and texture resolution, limits on\n  particles that are being rendered, fidelity of trail effects, post-effect\n  quality and more. On low quality levels some post effects may be completely\n  disabled and objects that are far away will not be rendered.\n\n  The specific effects of quality level on the individual elements of the scene\n  or individual rendering features are platform- and device- specific and can\n  not be relied upon.\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nitems:\n  - name: Automatic\n    summary: |\n      The quality level of graphics is determined automatically depending on the\n      client's setting for either game performance or graphic quality.\n    value: 0\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level01\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 1 - the lowest quality level.\n    value: 1\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level02\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 2.\n    value: 2\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level03\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 3.\n    value: 3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level04\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 4.\n    value: 4\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level05\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 5.\n    value: 5\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level06\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 6.\n    value: 6\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level07\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 7.\n    value: 7\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level08\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 8.\n    value: 8\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level09\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 9.\n    value: 9\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level10\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 10.\n    value: 10\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level11\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 11.\n    value: 11\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level12\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 12.\n    value: 12\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level13\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 13.\n    value: 13\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level14\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 14.\n    value: 14\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level15\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 15.\n    value: 15\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level16\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 16.\n    value: 16\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level17\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 17.\n    value: 17\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level18\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 18.\n    value: 18\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level19\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 19.\n    value: 19\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level20\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 20.\n    value: 20\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: Level21\n    summary: |\n      Graphic quality level 21, the highest quality level.\n    value: 21\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''",
