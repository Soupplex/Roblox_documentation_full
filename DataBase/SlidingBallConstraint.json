This constrains\n  the attachments so that their X axes are collinear but pointing in\n  opposite directions. It also constrains the attachments so that their Y\n  axes are parallel.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Linear Power\n\n  If this constraint's Class.SlidingBallConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to translate the attachments with the\n  goal of reaching Class.SlidingBallConstraint|Velocity. You can further\n  control this translation through both\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|MotorMaxAcceleration and\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|MotorMaxForce.\n\n  If this constraint's Class.SlidingBallConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set\n  separation specified by Class.SlidingBallConstraint|TargetPosition. This\n  translation is controlled by Class.SlidingBallConstraint|Speed,\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|LinearResponsiveness, and\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|ServoMaxForce.\n\n  #### Limits\n\n  You can set limits to restrict this constraint's sliding range. Enabling\n  the Class.SlidingBallConstraint|LimitsEnabled property exposes the\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|LowerLimit and\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|UpperLimit values, as well as\n  Class.SlidingBallConstraint|Restitution which defines the elasticity of the\n  attachments when they reach either limit.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants:\n  - CylindricalConstraint\n  - PrismaticConstraint\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SlidingBallConstraint.ActuatorType\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether the translation of the Class.SlidingBallConstraint is\n      actuated and, if so, what kind of actuation.\n    description: |\n      Sets whether the translation of the Class.SlidingBallConstraint is\n      actuated and, if so, what kind of actuation.\n\n      - If Class.SlidingBallConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n        Enum.ActuatorType|None, the joint can slide freely.\n\n      - If Class.SlidingBallConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n        Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to translate the attachments with\n        the goal of reaching Class.SlidingBallConstraint|Velocity.
