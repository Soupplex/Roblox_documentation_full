Class.Team objects\n  must be parented to the Teams service.\n\n  Teams offer a range of features that are useful to developers. These can\n  broadly be divided into features that work out-of-the-box and features\n  developers can program into their game.\n\n  Built-in team behavior The following functionality of Teams exists by\n  default and does not require the developer to program any custom behavior.\n\n  - When part of a Team, the name above a player's character Class.Model will\n    be colored to the Class.Team.TeamColor\n  - Changing Class.Player.TeamColor will cause Class.Player.Team switch to\n    the Team with the corresponding Class.Team.TeamColor\n  - When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed by\n    team\n  - Setting Class.Player.Neutral to true will cause the Class.Player to be\n    dis-associated with the team, but will not change Class.Player.Team or\n    Class.Player.TeamColor\n  - When a Class.Player joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with\n    Class.Team.AutoAssignable set to true that has the fewest players. If no\n    auto assignable team is available, Class.Player.Neutral will be set to\n    true\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to false, only players whose\n    Class.Player.TeamColor matches Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor can spawn\n    on that Class.SpawnLocation\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch is set to true, a player's\n    Class.Player.TeamColor will change to Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor when\n    their character touches the Class.SpawnLocation\n\n  Optional extended team behavior Many developers chose to add the following\n  features to teams in their own code.\n\n  - Implement checks for team in weapon code to prevent team killing\n  - Implement doors or other features that only certain teams can use\n  - Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance\ncodesamples:\n  - Team-Rebalance\n  - Team-Only-Door\n  - Team-Kill-Check\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: Teams:GetTeams\n    summary: |\n      Returns a table containing the game's Class.Team objects. Will only\n      return Class.Team objects that are parented to the Class.Teams\n      service.\n    description: |\n      The GetTeam function returns a table containing the game's Class.Team\n      objects.\n\n      Note this will only return Team objects that are directly parented to the\n      Class.Teams service. For this reason it is recommended developers only\n      parent Class.Team objects to the Class.Teams service and not to other\n      Class.Instance|Instances (or to each other).\n    codesamples:\n      - Teams-GetTeams\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Instances\n        summary: |\n          An array of Class.Team|Teams in the game.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: Teams:RebalanceTeams\n    summary: |\n      Evens the number of people on each team.
