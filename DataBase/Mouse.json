It remains supported\n  because of its widespread use, but you should strongly consider using these\n  alternatives.\n\n  The Mouse object houses various API for pointers, primarily for buttons\n  and raycasting. It can be accessed through Class.Player:GetMouse() called on\n  the Class.Players.LocalPlayer in a Class.LocalScript. It is also passed by\n  the Class.Tool.Equipped event.\n\n  - It is most notable for the Class.Mouse.Icon|Icon property, which changes\n    the cursor's appearance.\n  - It continually raycasts the screen mouse position into the 3D world using\n    the Class.Mouse.TargetFilter|TargetFilter property, storing the results of\n    the raycast in the Class.Mouse.Hit|Hit, Class.Mouse.Target|Target, and\n    Class.Mouse.TargetSurface|TargetSurface properties. These can be useful\n    for simple cases, but Class.WorldRoot:Raycast() should be used in more\n    complicated raycasting scenarios.\n  - Class.Plugin|Plugins can use Class.Plugin:GetMouse() to get a\n    Class.PluginMouse, which behaves similarly.\n\n  lua\n  -- From a LocalScript:\n  local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n  local player = Players.LocalPlayer\n  local mouse = player:GetMouse()\n  -- Setting the mouse icon\n  mouse.Icon = \"rbxasset://SystemCursors/Wait\"\n\n\n  Note:\n\n  - This object does not control/restrict pointer movement. For this, see\n    Class.UserInputService.MouseBehavior and\n    Class.UserInputService.MouseDeltaSensitivity.\n  - If two functions are connected to same input event, such as\n    Class.Mouse.Button1Down|Button1Down, both functions will run when the\n    event fires. There is no concept of sinking/passing input, as events don't\n    support this behavior. However, Class.ContextActionService does have this\n    behavior through Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction.\n  - While a mouse may not be available on all platforms, Mouse will still\n    function on mobile (touch) and console (gamepad), which don't typically have\n    mice or pointer hardware. For explicit cross-platform behaviors, use\n    Class.UserInputService and Class.ContextActionService.\n\n    See Input and Camera for more information on\n    customizing inputs in your experience.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - PlayerMouse\n  - PluginMouse\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Mouse.Hit\n    summary: |\n      The Datatype.CFrame of the mouse's position in 3D space.\n    description: |\n      This property indicates Datatype.CFrame of the mouse's position in 3D\n      space.

If the mouse is not\n      pointing at an object in 3D space (for example when pointing at the sky),\n      this property will be 1,000 studs away from the\n      Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera.\n    codesamples:\n      - Mouse-Hit-Laser-Beam\n      - mouse-origin-v-mouse-hit\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: Mouse.hit\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This property is a deprecated variant of Class.Mouse.Hit which should be\n      used instead.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: Mouse.Icon\n    summary: |\n      The content ID of the image used as the Class.Mouse icon.\n    description: |\n      Icon is a property that determines the image used as the pointer.

Note that these only work for Studio plugins; they will not\n      work for other Class.Mouse objects.\n\n\n\n\n                  Look\n                  Asset\n                  Suggested Use\n\n\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/Arrow\n                  Default clicking and selection.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/PointingHand\n                  Hovering over an active link/button.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/OpenHand\n                  Hovering over a draggable item.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/ClosedHand\n                  Dragging an item.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/IBeam\n                  Hovering in a text field.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SizeNS\n                  Hovering over a vertical resize handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SizeEW\n                  Hovering over a horizontal resize handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SizeNESW\n                  Hovering over a corner resize handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SizeNWSE\n                  Hovering over a corner resize handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SizeAll\n                  Hovering over a multi-direction resize handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SplitNS\n                  Hovering over a vertical \"split\" handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/SplitEW\n                  Hovering over a horizontal \"split\" handle.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/Forbidden\n                  Hovering over a locked/forbidden item.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/Wait\n                  Indicating an action is in progress.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/Busy\n                  Indicating the system is busy.\n\n\n\n                  rbxasset://SystemCursors/Cross\n                  Hovering over a pinpoint selection area.\n\n\n\n\n       These appearances are approximations &mdash; the actual look is dependent on your operating system.\n    codesamples:\n      - dragon-mouse-icon\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: Mouse.IconContent\n    summary: |\n      The content of the image used as the Class.Mouse icon.
