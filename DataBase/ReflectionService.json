You can use this service to dynamically inspect classes and their\n  properties, methods, and events, which can be useful for debugging, tooling,\n  or creating dynamic behaviors based on the engine's capabilities.\n\n  The following is an example script that inspects classes and their properties:\n\n  lua\n  local ReflectionService = game:GetService(\"ReflectionService\")\n\n  -- Create a SecurityCapabilities object with all capabilities\n  local allCapabilities = SecurityCapabilities.new(table.unpack(Enum.SecurityCapability:GetEnumItems()))\n\n  -- Get all classes accessible with all capabilities\n  local allClasses = ReflectionService:GetClasses({ Security = allCapabilities })\n  print(\"Total classes:\", #allClasses)\n\n  -- Get a specific class\n  local partClass = ReflectionService:GetClass(\"Part\")\n  if partClass then\n  \tprint(\"\\nPart class:\")\n  \tprint(\"  Name:\", partClass.Name)\n  \tprint(\"  Superclass:\", partClass.Superclass and tostring(partClass.Superclass) or \"none\")\n  end\n\n  -- Get the first 5 properties of a class\n  local properties = ReflectionService:GetPropertiesOfClass(\"Part\", { Security = allCapabilities })\n  print(\"\\nPart properties:\", #properties)\n  for i = 1, math.min(5, #properties) do\n  \tprint(\"  -\", properties[i].Name)\n  end\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: ReflectionService:GetClass\n    summary: |\n      Returns information about a class when given its name, assuming that class\n      is accessible.\n    description: |\n      Given a class name in the Roblox API, returns a ReflectedClass\n      dictionary with information about the associated class's reflection state.\n      If no such class name exists, returns nil.\n\n      If you pass in a ReflectionClassFilter dictionary, you can adjust the\n      set of eligible classes and adjust the output behavior:\n\n      lua\n      {\n      \t-- The security context to use; can be more expansive than the current script's security\n      \tSecurity: SecurityCapabilities?, -- default: SecurityCapabilities.fromCurrent()\n      \t-- Require classes to derive from the passed-in class name\n      \tIsA: string?, -- default: nil\n      \t-- Whether to exclude Studio display information about the class\n      \tExcludeDisplay: boolean?, -- default: false\n      }\n\n\n      If the class name is valid, you'll get the following ReflectedClass\n      dictionary as output:\n\n      lua\n      {\n      \t-- The name of the class\n      \tName: string,\n      \t-- Whether the class is serialized (able to be saved to disk)\n      \tSerialized: boolean,\n      \t-- The class's parent in the instance hierarchy (unless it's the root)\n      \tSuperclass: string?,\n      \t-- The names of the class's direct children in the instance hierarchy\n      \tSubclasses: {string},\n      \t-- Studio display information\n      \tDisplay: {\n      \t\t-- Always \"General\" for classes\n      \t\tCategory: string,\n      \t\t-- A message indicating that the class is deprecated, if applicable\n      \t\tDeprecationMessage: string?,\n      \t}?,\n      \t-- The security permissions required to access this class\n      \tPermits: {\n      \t\t-- If the class is a Service, the security capabilities required to obtain access.
