If this object is duplicated\n  within Studio and the value refers to an object also being copied, then the\n  new ObjectValue points to the copied object instead of the original.\n  Otherwise, the same value is kept. Copying and pasting this object clears the\n  value field.\n\n  You can set the value within Studio like other reference-type fields (such as\n  Class.Model.PrimaryPart): click the field within the Properties window, then\n  click the object you wish to set it to within the game view or Explorer\n  window. You can clear the field (set it to nil) by clicking the X that\n  appears when you click the field.\n\n  Like all Class.ValueBase objects, this single value is stored in the\n  Class.ObjectValue.Value|Value property. The Changed event fires with the\n  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the\n  property being changed.\n\n  If streaming is enabled, the Value\n  property is nil until the referenced object streams in, at which point the\n  Changed event fires.\ncodesamples:\n  - ObjectValue-Example\ninherits:\n  - ValueBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ObjectValue.Value\n    summary: |\n      Holds a reference to an instance.\n    description: |\n      Holds a reference to an instance.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Instance\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: ObjectValue.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.ObjectValue.Value is changed.\n    description: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.ObjectValue.Value changes.
