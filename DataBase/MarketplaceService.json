If you only need to determine the\n      IsSubscribed status of a user, it's recommended to use\n      Class.MarketplaceService:GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync()|GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync\n      as it is faster and more efficient for that particular purpose.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: user\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player object whose subscription details you want to\n          check.\n      - name: subscriptionId\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The ID of the subscription to check.\n    returns:\n      - type: Dictionary\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: MarketplaceService:GetUserSubscriptionPaymentHistoryAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns an Library.table|Array that contains up to one year of the\n      user's subscription payment history for the given subscriptionId.\n    description: |\n      Note: You can only call this method from a Class.Script with\n      Enum.RunContext.Server.\n\n      Returns an Library.table|Array that contains up to one year of the\n      user's subscription payment history for the given subscriptionId, sorted\n      from the most recent status to the least recent.\n\n      Each entry in the payment history Library.table|Array contains the\n      following keys:\n\n\n\n\n      \t    Key\n      \t    Type\n      \t    Description\n\n\n\n\n      \t  CycleStartTime\n      \t  Datatype.DateTime\n      \t  Datatype.DateTime at the start of this particular subscription period.\n\n\n      \t  CycleEndTime\n      \t  Datatype.DateTime\n      \t  Datatype.DateTime at the end of this particular subscription period.\n\n\n      \t  PaymentStatus\n      \t  Enum.SubscriptionPaymentStatus\n      \t  Enum.SubscriptionPaymentStatus.Paid if the user paid for this particular subscription period.\n          Enum.SubscriptionPaymentStatus.Refunded if the user refunded this particular subscription period.\n\n\n\n\n\n      #### Payment History Length\n\n      Only creators affiliated with the subscription product can access up to\n      one year worth of the user's subscription payment history.\n      Non-associated creators can only get the user's current subscription\n      payment status or an empty Library.table|Array if the user has no active\n      subscription.\n\n      #### Grace Period\n\n      Subscription renewal payments can have some processing time. Payment\n      history doesn't return a table for this period. However, in order to\n      preserve a user's subscription experience during the processing period,\n      Class.MarketplaceService.GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync()|GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync\n      returns IsSubscribed: true for the given user. Don't grant durable items\n      or currency type subscription benefits to the user until after payment has\n      been confirmed for the current cycle.\n\n      For example, on August 31, 2023, User A's Subscription B is up for\n      renewal. On September 1, 2023, the payment has yet to be processed. If you\n      call\n      Class.MarketplaceService.GetUserSubscriptionPaymentHistoryAsync()|GetUserSubscriptionPaymentHistoryAsync\n      on September 1, 2023 on User A for Subscription B, the first entry of the\n      return value is:\n\n\n\n\n      \t    Key\n      \t    Value\n\n\n\n\n      \t  CycleStartTime\n      \t  ...\n\n\n      \t  CycleEndTime\n      \t  August 31, 2023\n\n\n      \t  PaymentStatus\n      \t  Enum.SubscriptionPaymentStatus.Paid\n\n\n\n\n      Note that since the user is within the grace period, the cycle they have\n      yet to pay for (September 1, 2023) does not appear in the return value at\n      all. This field only populates after the payment has been received and\n      processed.\n\n      At the same time,\n      Class.MarketplaceService.GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync()|GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync\n      returns the following result until the renewal payment process fails or\n      the user cancels:\n\n\n\n\n      \t    Key\n      \t    Return\n\n\n\n\n      \t  IsSubscribed\n      \t  True\n\n\n      \t  IsRenewing\n      \t  True\n\n\n\n    codesamples:\n      - MarketplaceService-GetUserSubscriptionPaymentHistoryAsync1\n    parameters:\n      - name: user\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: subscriptionId\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: Array\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: MarketplaceService:GetUserSubscriptionStatusAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns a Library.table that contains the subscription status of the\n      user for the given subscriptionId.\n    description: |\n      Returns a Library.table that contains the subscription status of the\n      user for the given subscriptionId.

This callback must handle the receipts\n      for all developer products you have for sale.\n\n      IMPORTANT: We highly recommend that you properly implement the\n      ProcessReceipt callback in order to sell your developer products. You\n      should use ProcessReceipt to grant users their purchased product over\n      any other granting method. If your ProcessReceipt implementation isn't\n      correct, you will not be able to grant users the products they have\n      purchased on the Store tab of your experience details page.\n\n      ##### Guarantees\n\n      The ProcessReceipt callback is called for all unresolved developer\n      product purchases when:\n\n      - A user successfully completes the purchase of a developer product.\n      - A successful developer product purchase prompt appears to the user.\n      - A user joins the server.\n\n      A purchase is considered successfully initiated when:\n\n      - The purchase is processed on Roblox's backend.\n      - The funds are placed in escrow.\n\n      A purchase is considered resolved when:\n\n      - The ProcessReceipt callback returns a Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision\n        enum of Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted|PurchaseGranted.\n      - The purchase is successfully recorded on Roblox's backend.\n\n      ##### Unresolved developer product purchases\n\n      An unresolved developer product purchase takes place when a user's\n      purchase of a developer product has not yet been acknowledged by the\n      server through the ProcessReceipt function.\n\n      Unresolved developer product purchases are not removed or refunded after\n      the escrow period expires.\n\n      ##### Retries and timeouts\n\n      ProcessReceipt has no time-based retry mechanism. If a user makes a\n      purchase that returns a Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision enum of\n      Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted|NotProcessedYet, the\n      ProcessReceipt callback is only called again on the same server if:\n\n      - The user successfully initiates another developer product purchase.\n      - The user re-joins any server under the same experience.\n\n      ProcessReceipt also has no timeout for yielded callbacks. A\n      ProcessReceipt callback can yield for as long as the server is running,\n      and the callback result is still accepted when the result returns.\n\n      ##### Limitations\n\n      - If you don't implement a ProcessReceipt callback, your receipts will\n        be auto-acknowledged. You can't get a receipt back after it has been\n        acknowledged.\n      - When there are multiple purchases pending for a user, ProcessReceipt\n        callbacks are called in a non-deterministic order.\n      - The user must be on the server for the ProcessReceipt callback to be\n        invoked.\n      - The user does not have to be on the server for the result of the\n        ProcessReceipt callback to be recorded on the backend.\n      - The ProcessReceipt callback for a specific purchase might run on two\n        different servers at the same time if the user joins the second server\n        before the callback returns on the first server.\n      - The ProcessReceipt callback might still fail to be recorded on the\n        backend, even if it returns a Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision enum of\n        Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted|PurchaseGranted. When\n        this happens, the purchase remains unresolved.\n    codesamples:\n      - ProcessReceipt-Example\n    parameters:\n      - name: receiptInfo\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The receiptInfo table passed to this callback contains the following\n          data:\n\n          - PurchaseId &mdash; A unique identifier for the specific purchase.\n          - PlayerId &mdash; The user ID of the user who made the purchase.\n          - ProductId &mdash; The ID of the purchased product.\n          - PlaceIdWherePurchased &mdash; The place ID in which the purchase\n            was made.
