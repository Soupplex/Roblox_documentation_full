In order for this object to work correctly:\n\n  - The VelocityMotor must be parented inside of a Class.MotorFeature\n  - The Class.MotorFeature needs to be parented inside of a Class.BasePart\n  - A Class.Hole needs to be parented inside of another Class.BasePart\n  - The VelocityMotor's Class.VelocityMotor.Hole property should be assigned\n    to the hole you parented inside of the other part.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - JointInstance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: VelocityMotor.CurrentAngle\n    summary: |\n      Displays the angle that the motor is at in radians.\n    description: |\n      Displays the angle that the motor is at in radians.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: VelocityMotor.DesiredAngle\n    summary: |\n      The desired angle to be reached.
