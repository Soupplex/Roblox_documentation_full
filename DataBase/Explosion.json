Breaks Class.JointInstance|JointInstances and\n  Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints between parts and kills\n  Class.Humanoid characters not protected by a Class.ForceField.\ndescription: |\n  An Explosion applies force to Class.BasePart|BaseParts within the\n  explosion's Class.Explosion.BlastRadius|BlastRadius. This force breaks\n  Class.JointInstance|JointInstances and\n  Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints between parts and kills\n  Class.Humanoid characters not protected by a Class.ForceField.\n  Class.Constraint|Constraints will not be broken by an explosion.\n\n  If an Class.Explosion is parented anywhere in the data model while the\n  experience is running, it immediately sets off and, within a few seconds, it\n  becomes unparented. It is not destroyed with Class.Instance:Destroy() in\n  this case, so connections do not get disconnected and the parent is not\n  locked. As with all instances, keeping a strong reference an Class.Explosion\n  will prevent it from being garbage collected.\n\n  Note that an Class.Explosion must be a descendant of Class.Workspace for\n  the explosion visuals to play and the physical/damaging effects to have an\n  impact.\n\n  #### Explosion Effects\n\n  Class.Humanoid|Humanoids are killed by explosions, as the explosion breaks\n  the character Class.Model neck joint. Parenting a Class.ForceField to a\n  model will protect all of its children from the explosion kill effect.\n\n  If you do not want joints between Class.BasePart|BaseParts to be broken, or\n  you want to implement your own formula for damaging\n  Class.Humanoid|Humanoids, it's recommended that you set\n  Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent|DestroyJointRadiusPercent to 0 and\n  use the Class.Explosion.Hit|Hit event to handle the result of the explosion.\n\n  Explosions can also be configured to damage Class.Terrain, creating craters,\n  as configured through the Class.Explosion.ExplosionType|ExplosionType\n  property.\n\n  Note that the effect of an explosion is not disrupted by obstacles,\n  meaning that parts/terrain shielded behind other parts/terrain will still be\n  affected.\ncodesamples:\n  - Explosion-Instantiation\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Explosion.BlastPressure\n    summary: |\n      Used to determine the amount of force applied to\n      Class.BasePart|BaseParts caught in the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius.\n    description: |\n      Used to determine the amount of force applied to\n      Class.BasePart|BaseParts caught in the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius.\n\n      Currently this level of force applied does not vary based on distance from\n      Class.Explosion.Position. Unanchored BaseParts will accelerate equally\n      away from the origin regardless of distance provided they are within the\n      blast radius.\n\n      The blast pressure determines the acceleration of parts due to an\n      explosion. It does not determine the degree to which joints are broken.\n      When Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent is equal to 1 all joints\n      between parts in the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius will be destroyed\n      provided BlastPressure is greater than 0.\n\n      The BlastPressure also does not determine the amount of damage given to\n      Class.Terrain. Provided BlastPressure is greater than 0 and\n      Class.Explosion.ExplosionType isn't set to Enum.ExplosionType.NoCraters\n      the size of the crater created is determined exclusively by the\n      Class.Explosion.BlastRadius.\n\n      Setting BlastPressure to 0 eliminates the effect of the explosion and is\n      useful when developers want to program their own custom behavior for\n      explosions using the Class.Explosion.Hit event.\n    codesamples:\n      - Custom-Explosion\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.BlastRadius\n    summary: |\n      This property determines the radius of the Class.Explosion, in studs.\n      This radius determines the area of effect of the explosion, not the size\n      of the explosion's visuals.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the radius of the Class.Explosion, in studs.\n      This property accepts any value between 0 and 100.\n\n      This radius determines the area of effect of the Explosion, not the size\n      of the Explosion's visuals. The size of the Explosion's visual effect is\n      the same regardless of BlastRadius (even if BlastRadius is 0).\n\n      Class.BasePart|BaseParts within the BlastRadius will be affected by the\n      explosion. Meaning, if Class.Explosion.BlastPressure is greater than 0,\n      force will be applied to parts. The degree to which joints are broken\n      within the BlastRadius depends on\n      Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent. Class.Explosion.Hit will\n      fire for any every Class.BasePart within the radius.\n\n      Class.BasePart|BaseParts are considered within\n      Class.Explosion.BlastRadius even if they are only partially in range.\n    codesamples:\n      - Explosion-Instantiation\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent\n    summary: |\n      Used to set the proportion of the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius, between 0\n      and 1, within which all joints will be destroyed. Anything outside of this\n      range will only have the Class.Explosion force applied to it.\n    description: |\n      Used to set the proportion of the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius, between 0\n      and 1, within which all joints will be destroyed. Anything outside of this\n      range will only have the Class.Explosion force applied to it.\n\n      For example, if Class.Explosion.BlastRadius is set to 100 and\n      DestroyJointRadiusPercent is set to 0.5, any joints within a radius of 50\n      studs would be broken. Any joints between the ranges of 50 and 100 studs\n      wouldn't be destroyed, but the Class.Explosion force would still be\n      applied to the Class.BasePart|BaseParts.\n\n      This property allows developers to make Class.Explosion|Explosions\n      'non-lethal' to Class.Humanoid|Humanoids by setting\n      DestroyJointRadiusPercent to 0. This means the neck joint will not be\n      broken when characters come into contact with the Class.Explosion.\n    codesamples:\n      - Explosion-DestroyJointRadiusPercent\n      - Custom-Explosion\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.ExplosionType\n    summary: |\n      This property determines how the Class.Explosion will interact with\n      Class.Terrain.

It is an Enum.ExplosionType value and can be set to one\n      of three options.\n\n      - NoCraters - Explosions will not damage Terrain\n      - Craters - Explosions will create craters in Terrain\n      - CratersAndDebris - Redundant, behaves the same as Craters\n\n      If ExplosionType is set to create craters in Class.Terrain, the radius\n      of the crater will be roughly equal to the Class.Explosion.BlastRadius.\n      Craters are created in all Class.Terrain materials other than water. The\n      size of the crater is not influenced by the material, although some\n      materials create rougher edges than others.\n    codesamples:\n      - Explosion-ExplosionType\n    type: ExplosionType\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.LocalTransparencyModifier\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.Position\n    summary: |\n      This property is the position of the center of the Class.Explosion.

This means that although the\n      position of an explosion can be changed after it has been set it cannot\n      affect two different areas. Once an explosion has been 'detonated',\n      shortly after parenting it to a descendant of the Class.Workspace, it\n      will not do so again. In some cases the visual effect of the explosion\n      will move but it will have no effect.\n\n      For this reason a new Explosion should be created if the developer wants\n      an explosion to appear at a different position.\n    codesamples:\n      - Explosion-Instantiation\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Explosion.TimeScale\n    summary: |\n      Value between 0 and 1 that controls the speed of the particle effect.\n    description: |\n      A value between 0 and 1 that controls the speed of the particle effect.
