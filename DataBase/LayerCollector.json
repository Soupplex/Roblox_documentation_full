As a result, descendants of a Class.GuiObject need to have a\n      Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex value that's at least as high as the\n      parent, or they will render underneath their parent.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ZIndexBehavior\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods:\n  - name: LayerCollector:GetLayoutNodeTree\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Dictionary\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This method should not be used for new work.\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
