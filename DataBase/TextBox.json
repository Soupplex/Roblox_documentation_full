It behaves similarly to a\n  Class.TextButton, except that a single TextBox can be put in focus by\n  clicking, tapping, or gamepad selection. While in focus, the player can use a\n  keyboard to change the Class.TextBox.Text|Text property.\n\n  - If there is no text, the Class.TextBox.PlaceholderText|PlaceholderText\n    will be visible. This is useful prompting players of the kind or format of\n    data they should input.\n  - By default, the Class.TextBox.ClearTextOnFocus|ClearTextOnFocus property\n    is enabled and ensures there is no existing text when a TextBox is\n    focused. This may not be desirable for text that should be editable by the\n    player.\n  - The Class.TextBox.MultiLine|MultiLine property allows players to enter\n    multiple lines of text with newline characters (\\n).\n\n  #### Focus State\n\n  It is possible to detect and change the focus state of a TextBox:\n\n  - You can use Class.TextBox:CaptureFocus()|CaptureFocus when a dialogue\n    appears so that the player doesn't have to click on a TextBox when it\n    becomes available; you can use Class.ContextActionService:BindAction() to\n    bind a certain key to focus a TextBox using this function. When a\n    TextBox comes into focus, the Class.TextBox.Focused|Focused event fires.\n  - You can detect if a certain TextBox is in focus by using\n    Class.TextBox:IsFocused()|IsFocused. Alternatively,\n    Class.UserInputService:GetFocusedTextBox() can be used to check if any\n    TextBox is in focus.\n  - When the player is done inputting text, the\n    Class.TextBox.FocusLost|FocusLost event fires, indicating if the user\n    pressed Enter to submit text along with the Class.InputObject\n    that caused the loss of focus. When using on screen keyboards on mobile and\n    console,\n    Class.TextBox.ReturnPressedFromOnScreenKeyboard|ReturnPressedFromOnScreenKeyboard\n    may also fire.\n  - If some more important matter comes up during gameplay, you can\n    Class.TextBox:ReleaseFocus()|ReleaseFocus of the TextBox so that a\n    player's keyboard input returns to your game.\n\n  #### Text Editing\n\n  A TextBox supports text selection through its\n  Class.TextBox.CursorPosition|CursorPosition and\n  Class.TextBox.SelectionStart|SelectionStart properties. Using\n  Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()|GetPropertyChangedSignal, you can\n  detect when a selection changes. Additionally, it is possible for players to\n  copy and paste text within a TextBox, enabling basic clipboard support.\n\n  Text Filtering Notice Games that facilitate player-to-player communication\n  using text, such as custom chat or nametags, must properly filter such text\n  using Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync() or\n  Class.Chat:FilterStringAsync(). If this is not properly done, your game may\n  receive moderation action.\ncodesamples:\n  - TextBox-Secret-Word\ninherits:\n  - GuiObject\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TextBox.ClearTextOnFocus\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether clicking on the TextBox will clear its\n      Class.TextBox.Text property.\n    description: |\n      Determines whether clicking on the TextBox will clear its\n      Class.TextBox.Text property\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: TextBox.ContentText\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Text\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: TextBox.CursorPosition\n    summary: |\n      Determines the offset of the text cursor in bytes, or -1 if there is no\n      cursor.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the offset of the text cursor in bytes, or -1\n      if the Class.TextBox is not currently being edited.

When this is enabled,\n      Class.TextBox.TextSize is ignored and Class.TextBox.TextWrapped is\n      automatically enabled. This property is useful for text-rendering UI\n      elements within Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis.\n\n      When this property is used for screen-space UI, it may be desirable to use\n      a Class.UITextSizeConstraint to restrict the range of possible text\n      sizes.\n\n      #### TextScaled and AutomaticSize\n\n      It's recommended that developers avoid usage of TextScaled and adjust UI\n      to take advantage of the AutomaticSize property instead. Here are the core\n      differences between the two properties:\n\n      - TextScaled scales the content (text) to accommodate the UI. Without\n        careful consideration, some text may become unreadable if scaled too\n        small.\n      - AutomaticSize resizes the UI to accommodate content.\n\n      With AutomaticSize, you're able to adjust your UI to accommodate the\n      content (text) while maintaining a consistent font size. For more\n      information on how to use automatic sizing, see the UI Automatic Size\n      article.\n\n      We suggest that you don't apply both TextScaled and AutomaticSize on the\n      same UI object. If you apply both properties:\n\n      - AutomaticSize determines the maximum amount of available space that a\n        Class.GuiObject can use (in this case, text)\n      - TextScaled uses the available space determined by AutomaticSize, to\n        scale the font size to fit the available space, which will expand up to\n        the maximum font size (100), if there are no size constraints\n      - The end result will be: text goes to 100 font size and the UI object\n        will expand to fit that text\n\n      Using both AutomaticSize and TextScaled at the same time can result in\n      significant scaling differences than when AutomaticSize is off.\n    codesamples:\n      - Long-Text-Wrapping\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Text\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: TextBox.TextSize\n    summary: |\n      Determine the line height of text in offsets.\n    description: |\n      The TextSize property determines the height in offsets of one line of\n      rendered text.

Therefore, it's recommended to set\n      TextStrokeTransparency to a value in the range of 0.75 to 1 for more a\n      more subtle effect.\n    codesamples:\n      - Text-Highlight-Oscillation\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Text\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: TextBox.TextTransparency\n    summary: |\n      Determines the transparency of rendered text.\n    description: |\n      The TextColor3 property determines the transparency of all the text\n      rendered by a UI element.
