It is created when an input begins.\n\n  The properties of this object vary according the\n  Class.InputObject.UserInputType|UserInputType. Each kind of input will\n  undergo various changes to its\n  Class.InputObject.UserInputState|UserInputState. During the lifetime of an\n  input, other properties which further describe the input may change, such as\n  Class.InputObject.Position|Position and Class.InputObject.Delta|Delta.\n  Keyboard and gamepad button presses will have the\n  Class.InputObject.KeyCode|KeyCode property set.\n\n  Once created at the beginning of an input, the same object persists and is\n  updated until the input ends. As a result, you can track the object's changes\n  using the Class.Object.Changed|Changed event as the user changes the input\n  in question. You can also place these objects into a list of active inputs\n  track and interact with the object after it's creation by an event such as\n  Class.UserInputService.InputBegan. This is mostly useful for touch events,\n  as each touch point will have a separate InputObject.\n\n  See also Class.UserInputService whose events and functions often use\n  InputObject, and Class.GuiObject whose events related to user input use\n  InputObject.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: InputObject.Delta\n    summary: |\n      A Datatype.Vector3 describing the delta between input movements.\n    description: |\n      A Datatype.Vector3 describing the delta (change) between input\n      movements.\n\n      This is useful when used with the input's\n      Class.InputObject.Position|Position to track the position and movement\n      of the user's input, such as when you're creating custom movement or\n      camera scripts. Consider tracking input object changes using the\n      Class.Object.Changed event or when user input changes via events such as\n      Class.UserInputService.InputChanged and Class.GuiObject.InputChanged.\n\n      Note that an Class.InputObject corresponding to\n      Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton1 (left click) and\n      Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton2 (right click) supplied from an\n      Class.UserInputService.InputBegan|InputBegan callback will not have its\n      Class.InputObject.Delta|Delta or Class.InputObject.Position|Position\n      updated once created, except for when the mouse input ends. In order to\n      get updated deltas for mouse inputs, you must instead reference an\n      Class.InputObject from an\n      Class.UserInputService.InputChanged|InputChanged callback, or call\n      Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta(). However, any\n      Class.InputObject|InputObjects corresponding to touch inputs will have\n      their delta and position updated every frame throughout their lifetime.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n  - name: InputObject.KeyCode\n    summary: |\n      Contains an Enum that describes the kind of input used.\n    description: |\n      Contains a Enum.KeyCode enum that describes what kind of input was used.\n      For types of input like keyboard, this describes what key was pressed.
