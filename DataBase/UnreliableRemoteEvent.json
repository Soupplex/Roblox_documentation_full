Scripts firing a\n  Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent do not yield.\ndescription: |\n  The UnreliableRemoteEvent object is a variant of the Class.RemoteEvent\n  object. It facilitates asynchronous, unordered and unreliable, one-way\n  communication across the client-server\n  boundary without yielding for a response. This communication can be directed\n  from one client to the server, from the server to a specific client, or from\n  the server to all clients.\n\n  In order for both the server and clients to access a\n  Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent instance, it must be in a place where both sides\n  can see it, such as Class.ReplicatedStorage, although in some cases it's\n  appropriate to store it in Class.Workspace or inside a Class.Tool.\n\n  Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent is best used for ephemeral events, including\n  effects that are only relevant for a short time, or for replicating\n  continuously changing data. These events are not resent if they are lost and\n  they do not wait for previously fired events to arrive before being processed,\n  potentially resulting in reduced latency and network traffic. When you need\n  ordering and reliability, use a Class.RemoteEvent instead.\n\n  If no connected listener exists to handle an event, you might see a\n  Remote event invocation discarded error in the log to indicate that the\n  event was discarded and that you need to implement either OnClientEvent or\n  OnServerEvent.\n\n  #### Throttling\n\n  Remote events are subject to rate limits when sent from the client to the\n  server with the Class.RemoteEvent:FireServer()|FireServer() method.\n  Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents and\n  Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents both have a limit of\n  approximately 500 requests per second, per client. This limit is shared\n  among all remote events of the same type. To avoid throttling and latency\n  issues, limit recurring remote events whenever possible.\n\n  #### Parameter limitations\n\n  Any type of Roblox object (Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, etc.) can be\n  passed as a parameter when an Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent is fired, as well\n  as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should\n  carefully explore the\n  limitations.\n\n  Events with payloads larger than 1000 bytes are dropped. When this happens in\n  Studio, a log message in the Output window\n  indicates the number of bytes the event went over.\n\n  Like all events, the Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent methods encode and compress\n  certain object types, such as buffers, which shrinks the payload size and can\n  make it difficult to verify whether you are under the limit prior to firing\n  the event. If you frequently reach this limit, consider whether a standard\n  Class.RemoteEvent is the better fit for your use case.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BaseRemoteEvent\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: UnreliableRemoteEvent:FireAllClients\n    summary: |\n      Fires the Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent event\n      for all connected clients.
