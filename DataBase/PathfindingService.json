By default, the shortest path is calculated, but you\n  can implement pathfinding modifiers to compute smarter paths across various\n  materials, around defined regions, or through obstacles.\n\n  See Character Pathfinding for usage\n  details.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PathfindingService.EmptyCutoff\n    summary: |\n      Sets the percent of a voxel has to be occupied to be considered empty.\n      Defaults to 0.16.\n    description: |\n      This function worked with the legacy pathfinding system. The pathfinding\n      system currently uses a navigation grid and the EmptyCutoff is unused.\n\n      When the Class.PathfindingService computes a path using\n      Class.PathfindingService:ComputeRawPathAsync() or\n      Class.PathfindingService:ComputeRawPathAsync() it uses the voxel\n      representation of the world. A voxel is one cube in a grid overlaid on the\n      world. In this case the voxels being used are 4x4x4. This property sets\n      the percent of a voxel has to be occupied to be considered empty.
