    "content": "For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mover constraints, including Class.LinearVelocity, see mover constraints. Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\n\nA Class.LinearVelocity constraint applies force on an assembly to maintain a constant velocity. It can be set to apply force along a Datatype.Vector3, line, or 2D plane.\n\nThe Class.LinearVelocity constraint applies a force that attempts to maintain a constant linear velocity. If you want to control the amount of force applied, use a VectorForce constraint. Alternatively, if you only need initial linear velocity, set the Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity property directly on the assembly.\n\nRelativity\n\nApplication of velocity can be controlled through the constraint's Class.LinearVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo property. If set to Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World, force will be applied in world coordinates, independent of the parent or attachment orientations. If set to Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment0 or Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1, force will be applied relative to Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0 or Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 respectively.\n\n\n\n    RelativeTo = World\n\n\n\n    RelativeTo = Attachment0",
