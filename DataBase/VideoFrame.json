The video must be from a file uploaded to the Roblox website.\n\n  The video is scaled to fit the entirety of the rectangle, but looks best when\n  displayed at its native resolution.\n\n  ## 2D and 3D Sound\n\n  A VideoFrame placed underneath Class.SurfaceGui on a Class.BasePart will\n  emit its sound from that part's Class.BasePart.Position.\n\n  A VideoFrame exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch\n  varies with the relative motion of whatever part it is attached to.\n\n  The volume of the VideoFrame will be determined by the distance between the\n  client's sound listener (by default the Class.Camera position) and the\n  position of the VideoFrame's part.\n\n  A VideoFrame is considered \"global\" if it is not placed underneath\n  SurfaceGui on a BasePart. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume\n  throughout the entire place.\ncodesamples:\n  - creating-and-playing-a-video\ninherits:\n  - GuiObject\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: VideoFrame.IsLoaded\n    summary: |\n      Indicates when the Class.VideoFrame.Video has loaded from Roblox servers\n      and is ready to play.\n    description: |\n      This property will be true when the Class.VideoFrame.Video has loaded\n      from Roblox servers and is ready to play.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Video\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: VideoFrame.Looped\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether or not the Class.VideoFrame.Video repeats once it has\n      finished when it is playing.\n    description: |\n      This property sets whether or not the Class.VideoFrame.Video repeats\n      once it has finished when it is playing.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Video\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: VideoFrame.Playing\n    summary: |\n      Indicates whether the Class.VideoFrame.Video is currently playing.
