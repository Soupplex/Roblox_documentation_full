WedgeParts are great for\n  building slopes because of their slanted surface. They can even be rotated\n  onto their slant so that they can be used at an angle to make a triangular\n  ramp. WedgeParts can be adjusted to any size a regular brick can so that they\n  can be aligned with the rest of your building work. WedgeParts, when used next\n  to each other at different angles, can also make great curved ramps without\n  the need for CFrame too.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - FormFactorPart\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
