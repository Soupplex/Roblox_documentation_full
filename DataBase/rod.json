    "content": "For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mechanical constraints, including Class.RodConstraint, see Mechanical constraints. Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\n\nA Class.RodConstraint keeps two attachments separated by its defined Class.RodConstraint.Length|Length. By default, both attachments can rotate freely, although you can enable limits to restrict rotational tilt.\n\nLimits\n\nYou can limit rotation of the attachments within a cone, independently of each other, by enabling the Class.RodConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled property and setting Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle0|LimitAngle0 and Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle1|LimitAngle1 respectively.",
