If an argument isn't false or nil, then the operator evaluates it as true. Unlike many other languages, Luau considers both zero and the empty string as true. The following table summarizes how logical operators behave in conditionals.\n\n\n\n      Operator\n      Descriptions\n\n\n\n    and\n    Evaluates as true only if both conditions are true\n\n\n    or\n    Evaluates as true if either condition is true\n\n\n    not\n    Evaluates as the opposite of the condition\n\n\nand\n\nThe binary operator and returns one of the two arguments. If the first argument evaluates to true, then it returns the second argument. Otherwise, it returns the first argument.\n\nlua\nprint(4 and 5) -- 5\nprint(nil and 12) -- nil\nprint(false and 12) -- false\nprint(false and true) -- false\nprint(false and false) -- false\nprint(true and false) -- false\nprint(true and true) -- true\n\nYou can use and to test multiple conditions in control structures such as if statements and while loops. For example, the following if‑then statement tests that two conditions are both true:\n\nlua\nlocal pasta = true\nlocal tomatoSauce = true\n\nif pasta == true and tomatoSauce == true then\n\tprint(\"We have spaghetti dinner\")\nelse\n\tprint(\"Something is missing...\")\nend\n-- Output: We have spaghetti dinner\n\nor\n\nThe binary operator or returns one of the two arguments. If the first argument evaluates to true, then it returns the first argument. Otherwise, it returns the second argument.\n\nlua\nlocal y = x or 1\nprint(y) -- 1 because x doesn't exist and is therefore nil\n\nlocal d = false\nlocal e = d or 1\nprint(e) -- 1 because d is false\n\nprint(4 or 5) -- 4\nprint(nil or 12) -- 12\nprint(false or 12) -- 12\nprint(false or true) -- true\nprint(false or false) -- false\nprint(true or false) -- true\nprint(true or true) -- true\n\nYou can use or to perform complex logical tests in control structures. For example, the following if‑then statement tests whether two conditions are true or a third condition is true:\n\nlua\nlocal pasta = false\nlocal tomatoSauce = true\nlocal garlicBread = true\n\nif (pasta == true and tomatoSauce == true) or garlicBread == true then\n\tprint(\"We have either spaghetti dinner OR garlic bread\")\nelse\n\tprint(\"Something is missing...\")\nend\n\n-- Output: We have either spaghetti dinner OR garlic bread\n\nnot\n\nThe unary operator not returns the opposite boolean value of the argument. If the argument is false or nil, then it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.\n\nlua\nprint(not true) -- false\nprint(not false) -- true\nprint(not nil) -- true\nprint(not \"text\") -- false\nprint(not 0) -- false\n\nYou can use the not operator to trigger a conditional or loop if a variable is false or nil.\n\nlua\nlocal nilVariable  -- Variable is declared but has no value, so it's nil\nlocal falseVariable = false  -- Variable is declared with value of false\n\nif not nilVariable then\n\tprint(nilVariable)  -- Outputs \"nil\" because nil isn't true\nend\n\nif not falseVariable then\n\tprint(falseVariable)  -- Outputs \"false\" because false isn't true\nend\n\nYou can also use the not operator to test for the opposite of an entire multi-condition statement. In the following code sample, the if‑then conditional tests that it's neither true that three is greater than four nor is it true that five is greater than four.\n\nlua\nlocal three = 3\nlocal four = 4\nlocal five = 5\n\nif not (three > four or five\n\n\n      Operator\n      Description\n      Example\n      Associated metamethod\n\n\n\n    ==\n    Equal to\n    3 == 5 → false\n    eq\n\n\n    ~=\n    Not equal to\n    3 ~= 5 → true\n\n\n\n    >\n    Greater than\n    3 > 5 → false\n\n\n\n\n    Less than\n    3\n    lt\n\n\n    >=\n    Greater than or equal to\n    3 >= 5 → false\n\n\n\n\n    Less than or equal to\n    3\n    le\n\n\nArithmetic\n\nLuau supports the usual binary operators along with exponentiation, modulus, and unary negation.\n\n\n\n      Operator\n      Description\n      Example\n      Associated metamethod\n\n\n\n    +\n    Addition\n    1 + 1 = 2\n    add\n\n\n    -\n    Subtraction\n    1 - 1 = 0\n    sub\n\n\n\n    Multiplication\n    5  5 = 25\n    mul\n\n\n    /\n    Division\n    10 / 5 = 2\n    div\n\n\n    //\n    Floor Division\n\n      10 // 4 = 2\n      -10 // 4 = -3\n\n    idiv\n\n\n    ^\n    Exponentiation\n    2 ^ 4 = 16\n    pow\n\n\n    %\n    Modulus\n    13 % 7 = 6\n    mod\n\n\n    -\n    Unary negation\n    -2 = 0 - 2\n    unm\n\n\nCompound assignment\n\nYou can use compound assignment operators to set a variable equal to the result of an operation where the first parameter is the variable's current value.\n\nThe operation in a compound assignment occurs once. For example, if an expression generates a random index in a table, Luau uses the same index for both the operation and the assignment.\n\nIn the following examples, suppose local x = 3.\n\n\n\n      Operator\n      Operation\n      Example\n      New Value of x\n\n\n\n\n      +=\n      Addition\n      x += 2\n      5\n\n\n      -=\n      Subtraction\n      x -= 2\n      1\n\n\n      =\n      Multiplication\n      x = 2\n      6\n\n\n      /=\n      Division\n      x /= 2\n      1.5\n\n\n      //=\n      Floor Division\n      x //= 2\n      1\n\n\n      %=\n      Modulus\n      x %= 2\n      1\n\n\n      ^=\n      Exponentiation\n      x ^= 2\n      9\n\n\n      ..=\n      Concatenation\n      x ..= \" World!\"\n      \"3 World!\"\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nMiscellaneous operators include concatenation and length.\n\n\n\n      Operator\n      Description\n      Example\n      Associated metamethod\n\n\n\n    ..\n    Concatenates two strings\n    print(\"Hello \" .. \"World!\")\n    concat\n\n\n    #\n    Length of table\n    If tableVar = {1, 2, 3}, then #tableVar == 3.\n    len",
