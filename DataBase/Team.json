The only valid\n  parent for a Team is in the Class.Teams service. Teams offer a range of\n  features that are useful to developers that can be divided into two rough\n  groups:\n\n  - Features that work 'out of the box'\n  - Features developers can program into their game.\n\n  Built-in Team Behavior\n\n  The following functionality of Teams exists by default and does not require\n  the developer to program any custom behavior.\n\n  - When part of a Team, the name above a player's character Class.Model will\n    be colored to the Class.Team.TeamColor\n  - Changing Class.Player.TeamColor will cause Class.Player.Team to switch\n    to the Team with the corresponding Class.Team.TeamColor\n  - When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed\n    together as a team\n  - Setting Class.Player.Neutral to true will cause the Class.Player to be\n    disassociated with the team, but it will not change Class.Player.Team or\n    Class.Player.TeamColor\n  - When a Class.Player joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with\n    Class.Team.AutoAssignable set to true that has the fewest players. If no\n    auto assignable team is available, Class.Player.Neutral will be set to\n    true\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to false, only players whose\n    Class.Player.TeamColor matches Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor can spawn\n    on that Class.SpawnLocation\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch is set to true, a player's\n    Class.Player.TeamColor will change to Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor when\n    their character touches the Class.SpawnLocation\n\n  Optional Extended Team Behaviors\n\n  Many developers chose to add the following features to teams in their own\n  code.\n\n  - Implement checks in weapon code to prevent friendly fire.\n  - Implement checks in doors or other features that allow only certain teams to\n    use them\n  - Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance\ncodesamples:\n  - Team-Rebalance\n  - Team-Kill-Check\n  - Team-Only-Door\n  - Party-Team-Integration\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Team.AutoAssignable\n    summary: |\n      This property determines whether Class.Player|Players will be\n      automatically placed onto the Class.Team when joining.

Determines the\n      Class.Player.TeamColor property of players who are a member of the team.\n\n      A lot of Roblox's default team functionality is based on the team color,\n      rather than the name or object. For example,\n      Class.SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations can be assigned to a team via\n      Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor. For this reason it is recommended that\n      developers ensure each Class.Team has a unique TeamColor.\n\n      Any player which is a part of a team will have their name color changed to\n      the team's TeamColor property. They will also be put underneath the team\n      heading on the player list.\n    codesamples:\n      - Team-Only-Door\n    type: BrickColor\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\nmethods:\n  - name: Team:GetPlayers\n    summary: |\n      Returns a list of Class.Player|Players who are assigned to the\n      Class.Team.
