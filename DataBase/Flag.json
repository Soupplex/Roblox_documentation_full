When a player touches this object's Handle, which must be a\n  child of the Flag object, which is a Part named \"Handle\", the flag will be\n  added to the player's backpack and will appear in their hand. A player cannot\n  select other weapons while carrying a flag, and can drop the flag at anytime\n  by pressing \"Backspace\" on the keyboard. If the player carrying a flag steps\n  onto another FlagStand of a different team color, the flag will be removed\n  from the player's backpack and a point will be added to the user's\n  leaderstats, if provided. The flag will then regenerate at the originating\n  flag stand.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Tool\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  The Class.Flag and Class.FlagStand objects were created to allow\n  developers to make 'capture the flag' style games quickly.
