Also see Roblox units to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.\\n\\nThe Class.AlignOrientation constraint applies torque to align two attachments, or to align one attachment with a goal orientation. As indicated by the name, it only affects the orientation of the attachments, not their position (to align attachments positionally, see AlignPosition).\\n\\nBy default, the constraint only applies torque to Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0, although this behavior can be controlled through the constraint's reactionary torque.\\n\\nAffected axes\\n\\nThe axes affected by torque are controlled through the constraint's Class.AlignOrientation.AlignType|AlignType property. When set to Enum.AlignType.AllAxes|AllAxes (default), the constraint will apply torque about all 3 axes to achieve alignment. When set to Enum.AlignType.PrimaryAxisParallel|PrimaryAxisParallel, Enum.AlignType.PrimaryAxisPerpendicular|PrimaryAxisPerpendicular, or Enum.AlignType.PrimaryAxisLookAt|PrimaryAxisLookAt, torque will only occur when the primary axes become misaligned.\\n\\nTorque magnitude\\n\\nYou can configure the Class.AlignOrientation constraint to apply the maximum torque that constraints allow through the Class.AlignOrientation.RigidityEnabled|RigidityEnabled property. When true, the physics solver reacts as quickly as possible to complete the alignment. When false, the torque is determined by Class.AlignOrientation.MaxTorque|MaxTorque, Class.AlignOrientation.MaxAngularVelocity|MaxAngularVelocity, and Class.AlignOrientation.Responsiveness|Responsiveness.\\n\\nReactionary torque\\n\\nBy default, the constraint only applies torque to Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0 while Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 remains unaffected. If desired, torque can be applied to both attachments in equal and opposite directions by enabling Class.AlignOrientation.ReactionTorqueEnabled|ReactionTorqueEnabled.\\n\\nAttachment mode\\n\\nThe Class.AlignOrientation.Mode|Mode property specifies whether the constraint uses one or two attachments in calculating its goal. By default, this is Enum.OrientationAlignmentMode.TwoAttachment|TwoAttachment, meaning that the constraint attempts to match the orientation of Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0 with the orientation of Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1, disregarding Class.AlignOrientation.CFrame|CFrame, Class.AlignOrientation.PrimaryAxis|PrimaryAxis, and Class.AlignOrientation.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis.\\n\\nIf set to Enum.OrientationAlignmentMode.OneAttachment|OneAttachment, the constraint disregards Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 and attempts to match the orientation of Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0 with the orientation of Class.AlignOrientation.CFrame|CFrame, or match the attachment's Class.Attachment.Axis|Axis and Class.Attachment.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis with the constraint's Class.AlignOrientation.PrimaryAxis|PrimaryAxis and Class.AlignOrientation.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis properties respectively.\",\n    \"source\": \"align-orientation.md\"\n}",
