As the end points\n  (attachments) move, the direction of force will change accordingly.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Force Location\n\n  By default, force is applied to either parent at its attachment location. If\n  desired, force can be focused at each parent's center of mass by enabling\n  Class.LineForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass.\n\n  #### Inverse Square Law\n\n  When Class.LineForce.InverseSquareLaw|InverseSquareLaw is true, the force\n  magnitude is multiplied by the inverse square of the distance, meaning the\n  force will increase exponentially as the two attachments get closer together,\n  like magnets. When using this setting, it's recommended that you set a\n  Class.LineForce.MaxForce|MaxForce threshold to prevent infinite force if the\n  attachments align precisely.\n\n  #### Reactionary Force\n\n  By default, the constraint only applies force to\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0, while\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 remains unaffected. However, force\n  can be applied to both attachments in equal and opposite directions by\n  enabling Class.LineForce.ReactionForceEnabled|ReactionForceEnabled.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: LineForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass\n    summary: |\n      Whether force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly.\n    description: |\n      When true, force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly\n      of Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0, and the line determining the\n      direction of the force will start at the said center of mass. When\n      false, force is applied at Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0 and\n      the line determining the direction will also start at\n      Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: LineForce\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: LineForce.InverseSquareLaw\n    summary: |\n      When true, the force magnitude is multiplied by the inverse square of\n      the distance.\n    description: |\n      When true, the force magnitude is multiplied by the inverse square of\n      the distance.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: LineForce\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: LineForce.Magnitude\n    summary: |\n      The magnitude of the force.\n    description: |\n      The magnitude of the force.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: LineForce\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: LineForce.MaxForce\n    summary: |\n      Maximum absolute force that can be applied.\n    description: |\n      The maximum absolute force that can be applied.
