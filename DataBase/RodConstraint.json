By default, both attachments can rotate\n  freely, although you can enable limits to restrict rotational tilt.\n\n  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (A) to another part (B)\n  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (Z), part A will not\n  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.\n\n  #### Limits\n\n  You can limit rotation of the attachments within a cone, independently of each\n  other, by enabling the Class.RodConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled\n  property and setting Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle0|LimitAngle0 and\n  Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle1|LimitAngle1 respectively.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: RodConstraint.CurrentDistance\n    summary: |\n      The current distance between the constraint's\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.\n    description: |\n      The current distance between the constraint's\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Derived\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: RodConstraint.Length\n    summary: |\n      The distance apart at which the constraint attempts to keep its\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.\n    description: |\n      The distance apart at which the constraint attempts to keep its\n      Class.Attachment|Attachments.
