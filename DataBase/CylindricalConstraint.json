It can be thought of like a combination of a\n  Class.PrismaticConstraint and a Class.HingeConstraint. The sliding axis is\n  determined by the X axis of the constraint's\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0. The rotation axis is centered at\n  the constraint's Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 and is angled off\n  of the sliding constraint by the constraint's\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle|InclinationAngle.\n\n  This constraint, along with a Class.SpringConstraint, is ideal for building\n  vehicle suspension.\n\n  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (A) to another part (B)\n  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (Z), part A will not\n  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Angular Power\n\n  If a cylindrical's\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType is set\n  to Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to rotate the attachments with the\n  goal of reaching its\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity. You can further\n  control this rotation through both\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxAngularAcceleration|MotorMaxAngularAcceleration\n  and Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxTorque|MotorMaxTorque. If a\n  cylindrical's\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType is set\n  to Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to rotate to an angle specified by\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.TargetAngle|TargetAngle. This rotation is\n  controlled by Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularSpeed|AngularSpeed,\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularResponsiveness|AngularResponsiveness, and\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.ServoMaxTorque|ServoMaxTorque.\n\n  #### Linear Power\n\n  If a cylindrical's Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to translate the attachments with the\n  goal of reaching Class.CylindricalConstraint|Velocity. You can further\n  control this translation through both\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxAcceleration and\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxForce. If a cylindrical's\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorType|Servo, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set\n  separation specified by Class.CylindricalConstraint|TargetPosition. This\n  translation is controlled by Class.CylindricalConstraint|Speed,\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|LinearResponsiveness, and\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|ServoMaxForce.\n\n  #### Limits\n\n  You can set limits to restrict both the sliding range and rotation of\n  a cylindrical constraint. Enabling the\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|LimitsEnabled property exposes the\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|LowerLimit and\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|UpperLimit values, as well as\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint|Restitution which defines the elasticity of the\n  attachments when they reach either limit. Enabling the\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularLimitsEnabled|AngularLimitsEnabled\n  property exposes the Class.CylindricalConstraint.LowerAngle|LowerAngle and\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.UpperAngle|UpperAngle limits, as well as\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularRestitution|AngularRestitution which\n  defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach either limit.\n\n  #### Inclination Angle\n\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle|InclinationAngle defines the\n  direction of the rotation axis as an angle from the X axis in the XY\n  plane of Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0, from\n  -180 to 180. This lets you tilt the rotating element without\n  changing the sliding axis.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SlidingBallConstraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType\n    summary: |\n      Type of angular actuator.\n    description: |\n      If a cylindrical's\n      Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType is\n      set to Enum.ActuatorType|Motor, it attempts to rotate the attachments\n      with the goal of reaching its\n      Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity.
