They can be configured to allow only certain players to use each\n  spawn, using Class.Team|Teams. They also control how\n  Class.ForceField|ForceFields are set up for newly-spawned players.\n\n  SpawnLocations can be used as checkpoints, such as in an obstacle course,\n  using the Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch property, so that when\n  a player touches it, they will change teams to the SpawnLocation's team. In\n  this case, only the first Class.Team should have Class.Team.AutoAssignable\n  set to true, else players will not start at the first checkpoint.\n\n  Note if a SpawnLocation is added to the Class.Workspace in Studio with\n  Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral set to false a Team will be created\n  corresponding to Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor if it does not already exist.\n  This behavior does not occur when spawns are created in-game using a\n  Class.Script or if the properties of the SpawnLocation are changed after\n  already being added. It is recommended that developers always set up their\n  teams manually and not rely on this behavior.\n\n  ## Spawning Rules\n\n  There are several rules that come into play for a given SpawnLocation when a\n  player respawns:\n\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to false only\n    Class.Player|Players with Class.Player.TeamColor matching\n    Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor will respawn above it\n  - When Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral is set to true any Player can spawn above\n    it regardless of Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor\n  - If multiple eligible spawns are available to a Class.Player, a random one\n    will be chosen\n  - Players will spawn at different points on top of a SpawnLocation, but\n    currently, they may still spawn on top of each other if they spawn right\n    after one and other\n\n  See also:\n\n  - If you'd like to configure how long it takes for a player to respawn, take a\n    look at the Class.Players.RespawnTime|RespawnTime property\ncodesamples:\n  - SpawnLocation-Checkpoints\ninherits:\n  - Part\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch\n    summary: |\n      Allows a Class.Player to join the team by touching the\n      Class.SpawnLocation. When set to true, if a Class.Player character\n      comes into contact with the Class.SpawnLocation, the player's\n      Class.Player.TeamColor will be set to Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor.\n    description: |\n      Allows a Class.Player to join the team by touching the\n      Class.SpawnLocation. When set to true, if a Class.Player character\n      comes into contact with the Class.SpawnLocation, the player's\n      Class.Player.TeamColor will be set to Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor.\n      Class.Player.Neutral will also be set to Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral\n      upon contact, meaning a player can also become neutral by touching a spawn\n      location.\n\n      This will not function when Class.SpawnLocation.Enabled is set to false.\n\n      #### Making Checkpoints\n\n      This feature is often used to make checkpoints in obstacle courses or\n      similar games.\n    codesamples:\n      - SpawnLocation-Checkpoints\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Teams\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - Players\n  - name: SpawnLocation.Duration\n    summary: |\n      The length of time, in seconds, that a Class.ForceField will be applied\n      to a Class.Player character spawning at this Class.SpawnLocation. If\n      Duration is zero, the Class.ForceField is never created, and it will not\n      trigger the Class.Instance.DescendantAdded or\n      Class.Instance.ChildAdded events.\n    description: |\n      The length of time, in seconds, that a Class.ForceField will be applied\n      to a Class.Player character spawning at this Class.SpawnLocation. If\n      Duration is zero, the Class.ForceField is never created, and it will not\n      trigger the Class.Instance.DescendantAdded or\n      Class.Instance.ChildAdded events.\n\n      This default value of this property is 10 seconds.\n\n      The duration feature allows developers to easily give\n      Class.Player|Players protection from 'spawn killing' which can be a\n      frustrating experience for players. Note, Class.ForceField|ForceFields\n      will only protect users from Class.Explosion|Explosions and weapons that\n      use Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage() to deal damage or otherwise check for a\n      Class.ForceField.\n    codesamples:\n      - SpawnLocation-ForceField\n    type: int\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Forcefield\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - Players\n  - name: SpawnLocation.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether or not the Class.SpawnLocation is enabled.
