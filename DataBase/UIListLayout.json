The\n  Class.GuiObject.Position|Position and Class.GuiObject.Rotation|Rotation\n  properties of each sibling Class.GuiObject are either ignored or overridden\n  by the list layout, while each sibling retains its defined\n  Class.GuiObject.Size|Size unless the layout is configured to utilize a flex\n  layout. See List and Flex Layouts for\n  further information.\n\n\n\n  To control the layout order of siblings, set\n  Class.UIListLayout.SortOrder|SortOrder to either Enum.SortOrder.Name or\n  Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder, then rename siblings in alphanumerical order or\n  set their Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder|LayoutOrder value, respectively.\n  Class.UIListLayout will automatically re‑layout elements when elements are\n  added/removed, or if a sibling's Class.Instance.Name|Name or\n  Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder|LayoutOrder changes.\n\n\n\n  Padding between siblings is controlled through the\n  Class.UIListLayout.Padding|Padding property, and wrapping within the parent\n  container's bounds through the Class.UIListLayout.Wraps|Wraps boolean.\n  Alignment of siblings within the parent container is controlled through\n  Class.UIListLayout.HorizontalAlignment|HorizontalAlignment and\n  Class.UIListLayout.VerticalAlignment|VerticalAlignment unless the layout is\n  configured to utilize a\n  flex layout.\n\n  Note that there are performance implications of using a\n  flex‑enabled list layout,\n  since extra calculations are needed to calculate flex basis sizes, flexed\n  sizes, and line wrapping. Flex is enabled on a Class.UIListLayout when the\n  following properties are set, or if any Class.GuiObject sibling has a\n  Class.UIFlexItem parented to it:\n\n  - Class.UIListLayout.HorizontalFlex|HorizontalFlex and/or\n    Class.UIListLayout.VerticalFlex|VerticalFlex are not set to\n    Enum.UIFlexAlignment.None.\n  - Class.UIListLayout.ItemLineAlignment|ItemLineAlignment is not set to\n    Enum.ItemLineAlignment.Automatic.\n  - Class.UIListLayout.Wraps|Wraps is true.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIGridStyleLayout\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UIListLayout.HorizontalFlex\n    summary: |\n      Controls how to distribute extra horizontal space.\n    description: |\n      When the list layout's Class.UIListLayout.FillDirection|FillDirection is\n      set to Enum.FillDirection.Horizontal, the\n      Class.UIListLayout.HorizontalFlex|HorizontalFlex property specifies how\n      to distribute extra horizontal space in the parent container.\n\n\n\n\n            Setting\n            Sibling Behavior\n\n\n\n\n            Enum.UIFlexAlignment.None|None\n            No flex behavior; siblings maintain their defined width.\n\n\n            Enum.UIFlexAlignment.Fill|Fill\n            Siblings resize horizontally to fill the entire parent container, overriding their defined width. The number of siblings in a row remain unchanged; for example, if three siblings fit horizontally within the container's width under the Enum.UIFlexAlignment.None|None setting, those three siblings will resize to fill the entire width.\n\n\n            Enum.UIFlexAlignment.SpaceAround|SpaceAround\n            Siblings maintain their defined width. Equal spacing is added on both sides of each sibling.\n\n\n            Enum.UIFlexAlignment.SpaceBetween|SpaceBetween\n            Siblings maintain their defined width. Equal spacing is added between siblings, but no additional space is added around siblings.\n\n\n            Enum.UIFlexAlignment.SpaceEvenly|SpaceEvenly\n            Siblings maintain their defined width. Equal spacing is added both between and around siblings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ##### Cross-Direction Behavior\n\n      In vertical list layouts\n      (Class.UIListLayout.FillDirection|FillDirection set to\n      Enum.FillDirection.Vertical), the\n      Class.UIListLayout.HorizontalFlex|HorizontalFlex property specifies how\n      to distribute the siblings across the horizontal cross‑direction. In\n      such layouts, a setting of Enum.UIFlexAlignment.Fill makes the siblings\n      fill the entire horizontal space while vertical spacing adheres to\n      Class.UIListLayout.VerticalFlex|VerticalFlex.\n\n\n\n      ##### AutomaticSize Interaction\n\n      If Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize is enabled for a child of the\n      Class.UIListLayout in the\n      Class.UIListLayout.FillDirection|FillDirection, it is interpreted as\n      \"automatic flex basis\" and it defines the size of the Class.GuiObject\n      from which it can grow or shrink.\n\n      If Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize is enabled for a child of the\n      Class.UIListLayout in the cross‑direction, it is interpreted as\n      \"automatic cross size\" and it defines the minimum size needed to contain\n      all the child's content in the cross‑direction.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: UIFlexAlignment\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Alignment\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIListLayout.ItemLineAlignment\n    summary: |\n      In a flex layout, defines the cross-directional alignment of siblings\n      within a line.\n    description: |\n      In a flex layout, defines\n      the cross-directional alignment of siblings within a line.
