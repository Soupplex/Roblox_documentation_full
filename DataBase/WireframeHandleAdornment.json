If parented to a player's Class.PlayerGui or the\n  Class.CoreGui, this adornment can listen to input events for purposes such\n  as making dragger tools.\n\n  Note that a WireframeHandleAdornment instance begins empty and you must\n  add lines or paths to it through methods like\n  Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddLines()|AddLines() or\n  Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddPath()|AddPath().\n\n  The rendered wireframe can be customized visually through its\n  Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Thickness|Thickness,\n  Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Color3|Color3, and\n  Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Transparency|Transparency properties,\n  although these properties only affect subsequent draws and do not update lines\n  already drawn into the adornment.\ncodesamples:\n  - WireframeHandleAdornment-Basic-Path\n  - WireframeHandleAdornment-Multicolor\ninherits:\n  - HandleAdornment\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: WireframeHandleAdornment.Scale\n    summary: |\n      The XYZ scale of the wireframe adornment.\n    description: |\n      This property specifies the XYZ scale of the wireframe adornment as a\n      Datatype.Vector3. For example, a scale of\n      Datatype.Vector3.new(1, 2, 1) will scale the adornment twice its normal\n      size on the Y axis while keeping the X and Z axes unchanged.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: WireframeHandleAdornment.Thickness\n    summary: |\n      Thickness of the wireframe adornment's lines in pixels.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the thickness of the wireframe adornment's lines\n      in pixels.
