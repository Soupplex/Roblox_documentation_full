They work\\n  when parented to Class.BasePart, Class.Model, or Class.Folder objects.\\n  They detect basic mouse events: enter, leave, left click and right click.\\n  Touch input on Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled devices also\\n  fires click events.\\n\\n  The default control scripts bind Enum.KeyCode|ButtonR2 to interact with\\n  Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors using\\n  Class.ContextActionService:BindActivate(), which can also be used to\\n  override this. When using gamepads, the center dot triggers\\n  Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverEnter|MouseHoverEnter and\\n  Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverLeave|MouseHoverLeave. The bound activation\\n  button fires Class.ClickDetector.MouseClick|MouseClick.\\n\\n  Class.ClickDetector.MaxActivationDistance|MaxActivationDistance can be used\\n  to limit the distance a player may be from a click detector before it is no\\n  longer clickable.\\n\\n  Class.ClickDetector events fire on both the client and the server. Since a\\n  Class.LocalScript will only run if it descends from a Class.Player or\\n  player Class.Player.Character|Character, it's usually not useful to put a\\n  Class.LocalScript inside a Class.ClickDetector, since the script won't run\\n  or the object won't be clickable. If you need a Class.LocalScript to detect\\n  Class.ClickDetector events, Class.StarterPlayerScripts may be a better\\n  place instead.\\n\\n  #### Input Priority\\n\\n  If multiple Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors may detect user input, only\\n  the deepest will fire events. If two Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors are\\n  siblings, the first will take priority.\\n\\n  If an action bound with Class.ContextActionService uses the same input as a\\n  Class.ClickDetector, the action bound with Class.ContextActionService will\\n  take priority over the click detector's events.\\n\\n  Class.UserInputService.InputBegan will fire before Class.ClickDetector\\n  events.\\ncodesamples:\\n  - ClickDetector-Example\\n  - Part-Anchored-Toggle\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants:\\n  - DragDetector\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: ClickDetector.CursorIcon\\n    summary: |\\n      Sets the cursor icon to display when the mouse is hovered over the parent\\n      of this Class.ClickDetector or Class.DragDetector.\\n    description: |\\n      Sets the cursor icon to display when the mouse is hovered over the parent\\n      of this Class.ClickDetector or Class.DragDetector.
