The part which is controlled depends on the name\n  of the Pose.\ndescription: |\n  A Pose holds the Datatype.CFrame applied to the Class.Motor6D connected to\n  its associated Class.BasePart. The part which is controlled depends on the\n  name of the Pose.\n\n  Poses are the fundamental building blocks of animations and, with Keyframes,\n  make up KeyframeSequences.\n\n  ## Poses, joints and hierarchy\n\n  Although a Pose is assigned to a Class.BasePart by name, the object\n  manipulated during animation playback is actually the Class.Motor6D\n  connected to this part. Animation rigs branch out from the model's root part\n  through such joints.\n\n  In a R15 character rig, the root part is the HumanoidRootPart. The LowerTorso\n  is connected to the HumanoidRootPart by the a motor named 'Root'. Therefore,\n  the Datatype.CFrame of a Pose named 'LowerTorso' in a Class.Keyframe would\n  be applied to the motor named 'Root', and not the LowerTorso itself.\n\n  Poses are arranged in a Class.Keyframe based on joint hierarchy. This means,\n  the Pose's Datatype.CFrame is applied to the motor connecting the part\n  associated with the pose to the part associated with the pose's parent. See\n  below for a visual example of the structure of Poses on a R15 character.\n\n  ## Pose CFrame\n\n  The Roblox animation system applies Class.Pose.CFrame to the corresponding\n  Class.Motor6D by manipulating the relative transformation of the motor, the\n  Class.Motor6D.Transform property. The original Class.JointInstance.C1|C0\n  and Class.JointInstance.C1|C1 values are not changed.\ncodesamples:\n  - Keyframe-Generate-Poses\n  - Keyframe-Reset-Poses\ninherits:\n  - PoseBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Pose.CFrame\n    summary: |\n      This Datatype.CFrame applies to the Class.Motor6D corresponding with\n      the Class.Pose when the Class.Motor6D.Transform is changed.\n    description: |\n      This Datatype.CFrame applies to the Class.Motor6D corresponding with\n      the Class.Pose when the Class.Motor6D.Transform is changed.

This means, that the Class.Pose.CFrame is applied to the\n      motor connecting the part associated with the pose to the part associated\n      with the pose's parent.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Animation\n  - name: Pose.MaskWeight\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This property is deprecated.
