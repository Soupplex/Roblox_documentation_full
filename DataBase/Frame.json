You can use it for UI that either displays on a\n  user's screen or on a\n  surface within the experience.\n\n\n\n  Class.Frame|Frames are ideal containers for responsive layouts such as\n  list and flex layouts, allowing you to\n  change the size of the frame and dynamically adjust how layout items fit\n  within it. Class.Frame|Frames are also core Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects, so\n  you can customize properties such as\n  Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3,\n  Class.GuiObject.Transparency|Transparency, apply a\n  background gradient or\n  border, and more.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiObject\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Frame.Style\n    summary: |\n      Sets what the frame looks like from a selection of pre-determined styles.\n    description: |\n      Sets what the frame looks like from a selection of pre-determined styles.\n      See Enum.FrameStyle for a description of each style.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: FrameStyle\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
