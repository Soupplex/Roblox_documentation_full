Whenever its\n  input stream exceeds a specified maximum level, the stream's volume is reduced\n  for a moment. AudioLimiter provides a single Input pin, and a single\n  Output pin that can be connected to/from by Class.Wires.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AudioLimiter.Bypass\n    summary: |\n      Whether audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    description: |\n      If true, audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Audio\n  - name: AudioLimiter.MaxLevel\n    summary: |\n      The maximum volume tolerated.\n    description: |\n      The maximum volume, in decibels, that the limiter will allow to pass\n      through without reduction.
