Each sphere also has\n      an arrow drawn in 3D, facing the surface that the contact point is\n      detecting.\n\n      #### Solver Variations\n\n      The behavior of this property varies depending on whether Roblox's physics\n      engine is using the PGS Physics Solver, or the Spring Physics Solver.\n\n      This is controlled by the Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\n      property.\n\n      ##### Spring Physics Solver\n\n      When Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled is set to false, the\n      contact points are color coded as listed below. The length of the arrow\n      extruding from the sphere depends on how much force the contact point is\n      exerting, and what the contact type is.\n\n\n\n      \t\tColor\n      \t\tContact Type\n      \t\tDescription\n\n\n\n      \t\tNormal Contact\n      \t\tContact point with no special conditions.\n\n\n\n      \t\tResting Contact\n      \t\tContact point that has been active for at least 4 frames.\n\n\n\n      \t\tSecond Pass Contact\n      \t\tContact point that was made by a kernel joint going through a second pass. Rarely seen.\n\n\n\n      \t\tReal-Time Contact\n      \t\tContact point that was made with a real-time physics body. This applies to tripped Class.Humanoid.\n\n\n\n      \t\tJoint Contact\n      \t\tContact point that was made under the context of a physically simulated joint. This applies to Motors and Hinges.\n\n\n      PGS Physics Solver\n\n      When Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled is set to true, the contact\n      points are always colored RED, and the length of the arrow will always\n      be 1 stud. There are no special conditions tracked, because the PGS solver\n      does not keep specific lookup tables for the states listed in the Spring\n      Solver.\n\n\n\n      \t\tColor\n      \t\tContact Type\n      \t\tDescription\n\n\n\n      \t\tNormal Contact\n      \t\tContact point with no special conditions.\n\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Display\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PhysicsSettings.AreGravityForcesShownForSelectedOrHoveredAssemblies\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxScriptSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Display\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PhysicsSettings.AreJointCoordinatesShown\n    summary: |\n      When set to true, XYZ axes are rendered at the Class.BasePart.CFrame of\n      every part.\n    description: |\n      When set to true, XYZ axes are rendered at the Class.BasePart.CFrame of\n      every part.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Display\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PhysicsSettings.AreMagnitudesShownForDrawnForcesAndTorques\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxScriptSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Display\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PhysicsSettings.AreMechanismsShown\n    summary: |\n      When set to true, every individual mechanism of parts is given a unique\n      color.\n    description: |\n      When set to true, every individual mechanism of parts is given a unique\n      color.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Display\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: PhysicsSettings.AreModelCoordsShown\n    summary: |\n      An ancient property that hasn't work correctly since late 2007.
