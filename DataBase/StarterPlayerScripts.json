It can contain Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts\n  and other objects to be copied to the Class.PlayerScripts container once\n  when a Class.Player joins the game. For example, if you want to create\n  special effects on the client when certain conditions are met, you can place a\n  Class.LocalScript within this container to do that.\n\n  When an experience is run, this object will also house the default\n  multi-platform Roblox control scripts for the camera and character. If\n  Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts named CameraScript or ControlScript are\n  placed within this container, they will replace the Roblox defaults for\n  those scripts respectively. If desired, you can add empty\n  Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts for each of these to disable them altogether;\n  this is useful for experiences that do not follow the typical control\n  paradigms of a Roblox experience.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - StarterCharacterScripts\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
