Specifically, torsion springs try to bring two axes\n  from two parts together in a compliant way.\n\n  Correct orientation of a torsion spring's attachments is important. The\n  constraint will attempt to bring the\n  Class.Attachment.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis of each attachment into\n  alignment. When building mechanisms like swinging doors, ensure that the\n  secondary axes are perpendicular to the intended axis of rotation.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Damping\n\n  The Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Damping|Damping value controls how fast\n  the spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to\n  oscillate endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more\n  quickly.\n\n  #### Stiffness\n\n  Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Stiffness|Stiffness sets the torsional\n  strength of the spring. Higher values create a spring that responds with more\n  force.\n\n  #### Limits\n\n  Enabling the Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled\n  property exposes the Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.MaxAngle|MaxAngle value\n  to restrict the spring's range within a cone; it also exposes the\n  Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Restitution|Restitution value which defines\n  the elasticity of the attachments when they reach their limit.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TorsionSpringConstraint.Coils\n    summary: |\n      The number of coils visualized for the constraint.\n    description: |\n      This property indicates the number of spring coils for visualization.\n      Default value is 8.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: TorsionSpringConstraint.CurrentAngle\n    summary: |\n      The current angle, in degrees, of the limiting cone.\n    description: |\n      The current angle, in degrees, of the torsion spring's limiting cone.
