It is created automatically\n  when a player joins the game. Its main purpose is to contain\n  Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts copied from the Class.StarterPlayerScripts\n  container within the Class.StarterPlayer game service, which happens once\n  upon creation. Descendant LocalScripts of Class.PlayerScripts will run\n  code on the client of the Class.Player.\n\n  Unlike the Class.Backpack and Class.PlayerGui containers, the\n  Class.PlayerScripts container is not accessible to the server. Server\n  Class.Script objects will not run when parented to Class.PlayerScripts.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: PlayerScripts:ClearComputerCameraMovementModes\n    summary: |\n      Unregisters all ComputerCameraMovementMode enums from the experience's\n      settings menu.\n    description: |\n      Unregisters all ComputerCameraMovementMode enums from the experience's\n      settings menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:ClearComputerMovementModes\n    summary: |\n      Unregisters all ComputerMovementMode enums from the experience's settings\n      menu.\n    description: |\n      Unregisters all ComputerMovementMode enums from the experience's settings\n      menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:ClearTouchCameraMovementModes\n    summary: |\n      Unregisters all TouchCameraMovementMode enums from the experience's\n      settings menu.\n    description: |\n      Unregisters all TouchCameraMovementMode enums from the experience's\n      settings menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:ClearTouchMovementModes\n    summary: |\n      Unregisters all TouchMovementMode enums from the experience's settings\n      menu.\n    description: |\n      Unregisters all TouchMovementMode enums from the experience's settings\n      menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:RegisterComputerCameraMovementMode\n    summary: |\n      Registers that a computer camera movement mode is available to be selected\n      from the game menu.\n    description: |\n      Registers that a computer camera movement mode is available to be selected\n      from the game menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: cameraMovementMode\n        type: ComputerCameraMovementMode\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:RegisterComputerMovementMode\n    summary: |\n      Registers that a computer movement mode is available to be selected from\n      the game menu.\n    description: |\n      Registers that a computer movement mode is available to be selected from\n      the game menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: movementMode\n        type: ComputerMovementMode\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:RegisterTouchCameraMovementMode\n    summary: |\n      Registers that a touch camera movement mode is available to be selected\n      from the game menu.\n    description: |\n      Registers that a touch camera movement mode is available to be selected\n      from the game menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: cameraMovementMode\n        type: TouchCameraMovementMode\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: PlayerScripts:RegisterTouchMovementMode\n    summary: |\n      Registers that a touch movement mode is available to be selected from the\n      game menu.\n    description: |\n      Registers that a touch movement mode is available to be selected from the\n      game menu.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: movementMode\n        type: TouchMovementMode\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Input\n      - Players\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
