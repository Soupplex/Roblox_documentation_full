Similar to Class.Decal|Decals and Class.Texture|Textures, UI\n  objects such as Class.TextLabel|TextLabels and\n  Class.ImageLabel|ImageLabels parented to a Class.SurfaceGui face the same\n  direction as the surface they're on, editable through the\n  Class.SurfaceGui.Face|Face property.\n\n\n\n  Note that interactive UI elements like Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons and\n  Class.TextButton|TextButtons inside a Class.SurfaceGui will only receive\n  user input if they are parented to the Class.PlayerGui, typically via\n  placing the Class.SurfaceGui inside Class.StarterGui (the\n  Class.SurfaceGui.Adornee|Adornee property can be used to target a part in\n  the 3D world while the Class.SurfaceGui itself remains in the\n  Class.PlayerGui). Additionally, the part's\n  Class.BasePart.CanQuery|CanQuery property must be true for the interactive\n  UI element to receive input.\n\n  See In-Experience UI for\n  a guide on working with Class.SurfaceGui containers.\n\n  ##### Caching Behavior\n\n  To help improve performance, the appearance of a Class.SurfaceGui is cached\n  until one of the following occurs, after which its appearance will be\n  recomputed on the next rendering frame.\n\n  - A descendant is added to or removed from the Class.SurfaceGui.\n  - A property of a descendant of the Class.SurfaceGui changes.\n  - A property of the Class.SurfaceGui itself changes.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SurfaceGuiBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SurfaceGui.AlwaysOnTop\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the Class.SurfaceGui will always be rendered on top\n      of other 3D objects.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the Class.SurfaceGui will always render\n      on top of other 3D objects.\n\n      When set to false (default), the Class.SurfaceGui renders like other\n      3D content and is occluded by other 3D objects. When set to true, the\n      Class.SurfaceGui always renders on top of 3D content and the appearance\n      changes significantly:\n\n      - Colors match how they appear inside a Class.ScreenGui.\n      - Text may appear sharper on high DPI devices.\n      - Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is treated as though\n        it's 0.\n      - Class.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness has no effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.Brightness\n    summary: |\n      Determines the factor by which the Class.SurfaceGui container's light is\n      scaled when Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 0.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the factor by which the Class.SurfaceGui\n      container's light is scaled when\n      Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 0. By default, this\n      property is 1 and can be set to any number between 0 and 1000. By\n      modifying this property, the apparent brightness of a Class.SurfaceGui\n      can be better matched to its environment. For instance, a video billboard\n      can be brightened inside a dark room by increasing\n      Class.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness to 10.\n\n      Note that Class.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness is inaccessible in\n      Studio and has no effect when either\n      Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 1 or\n      Class.SurfaceGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop is true.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.CanvasSize\n    summary: |\n      The size of a \"virtual screen\" in \"virtual pixels\" which makes\n      Class.SurfaceGui|SurfaceGuis pixel-to-pixel compatible with\n      Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis.\n    description: |\n      The size of a \"virtual screen\" in \"virtual pixels\" which makes\n      Class.SurfaceGui|SurfaceGuis pixel-to-pixel compatible with\n      Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector2\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Sizing\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.ClipsDescendants\n    summary: |\n      Whether portions of Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects that fall outside of the\n      Class.SurfaceGui canvas borders will be drawn.\n    description: |\n      When set to true (default), portions of Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects\n      that fall outside of the Class.SurfaceGui canvas borders will not be\n      drawn.\n\n      Even when this property is false, Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects that are\n      completely outside of the canvas will not render.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.LightInfluence\n    summary: |\n      Controls how much the Class.SurfaceGui is influenced by environmental\n      lighting.\n    description: |\n      Controls how much the Class.SurfaceGui is influenced by environmental\n      lighting, in a range from 0 to 1. Setting this to 1 means that\n      surrounding lighting has complete control over the appearance, while\n      setting it to 0 means that the lighting has no effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.MaxDistance\n    summary: |\n      Controls how far away the Class.SurfaceGui can be displayed before it\n      stops rendering.\n    description: |\n      This property controls how far from the camera the Class.SurfaceGui will\n      be displayed before it stops rendering. A value of 0 means there is no\n      limit and it will render infinitely far away. The default value of 1000\n      works fine for most cases.\n\n      For Class.SurfaceGui|SurfaceGuis that appear outdoors, it's recommended\n      that Class.SurfaceGui.MaxDistance|MaxDistance is high enough to ensure\n      that the container's UI is sufficiently small on the screen when it\n      appears or disappears, minimizing the sudden pop‑in/out effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.PixelsPerStud\n    summary: |\n      Determines the density of pixels used for each world-space stud to render\n      the contents of the Class.SurfaceGui.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the density of pixels used for each world-space\n      stud to render the contents of the Class.SurfaceGui. Higher values will\n      cause the various Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects within to appear smaller if\n      they are kept the same size. Conversely, lower values will cause objects\n      to appear larger. However, if the Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects are scaled\n      proportionally through use of Class.UIScale, Class.GuiObject.Size,\n      Class.TextLabel.TextSize, or similar, this property allows for higher\n      definition to be used.\n\n      It's important to select a value based on how far away you expect a player\n      to view the Class.SurfaceGui. Also be mindful that a large pixel density\n      could negatively affect performance if the face of the adorned part is\n      large enough.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Sizing\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.SizingMode\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the Class.SurfaceGui will render at a fixed size or\n      scale with its size in studs.\n    description: |\n      When set to Enum.SurfaceGuiSizingMode.PixelsPerStud (default), the\n      Class.SurfaceGui renders with a variable size based on\n      Class.SurfaceGui.PixelsPerStud|PixelsPerStud and the surface's size in\n      studs.\n\n      When set to Enum.SurfaceGuiSizingMode.FixedSize, the Class.SurfaceGui\n      renders with a fixed size set through\n      Class.SurfaceGui.CanvasSize|CanvasSize.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: SurfaceGuiSizingMode\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Sizing\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: SurfaceGui.ToolPunchThroughDistance\n    summary: |\n      Sets the distance in which left clicking starts acting on the\n      Class.SurfaceGui instead of for the held Class.Tool.\n    description: |\n      Sets the distance in which left clicking starts acting on the\n      Class.SurfaceGui instead of for the held Class.Tool.
