This impacts any Class.Sound parented\n      to a Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment.\n\n      The Doppler effect is a phenomenon whereby the pitch of a sound changes as\n      the source and observer of the sound move further away or closer together,\n      which is stronger the more quickly they are moving. Increasing\n      Class.SoundService.DopplerScale exaggerates the impact of this effect,\n      whereas decreasing it minimizes it.

More precisely, the volume of\n      the Class.Sound will still start attenuating at a distance equal to\n      Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance, but the attenuation curve will be\n      steeper or more gradual based on the value of\n      Class.SoundService.RolloffScale|RolloffScale.
