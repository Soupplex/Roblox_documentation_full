It grants the model with the ability to physically walk around and\n  interact with various components of a Roblox experience. Humanoids are always\n  parented inside of a Class.Model, and the model is expected to be an\n  assembly of Class.BasePart and Class.Motor6D; the root part of the\n  assembly is expected to be named HumanoidRootPart. It also expects a part\n  named Head to be connected to the character's torso part, either directly or\n  indirectly. By default, there are two official types of character rigs\n  supplied by Roblox, each with their own set of rules:\n\n  ## R6\n\n  - A basic character rig that uses 6 parts for limbs.\n  - The Head part must be attached to a part named Torso, or the Humanoid\n    will die immediately.\n  - BodyPart appearances are applied using Class.CharacterMesh objects.\n  - Certain properties, such as Class.Humanoid.LeftLeg and\n    Class.Humanoid.RightLeg, only work with R6.\n\n  ## R15\n\n  - More complex than R6, but also far more flexible and robust.\n  - Uses 15 parts for limbs.\n  - The Head part must be attached to a part named UpperTorso or the\n    Humanoid will die immediately.\n  - BodyPart appearances have to be assembled directly.\n  - Can be dynamically rescaled by using special Class.NumberValue objects\n    parented inside of the Humanoid.\n  - The Humanoid will automatically create Class.Vector3Value objects named\n    OriginalSize inside of each limb.\n  - If a NumberValue is parented inside of the Humanoid and is named one of the\n    following, it will be used to control the scaling functionality:\n    - BodyDepthScale\n    - BodyHeightScale\n    - BodyWidthScale\n    - HeadScale\ncodesamples:\n  - Walking-Camera-Bobble-Effect\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled\n    summary: |\n      Sets whether the character will automatically jump when they hit an\n      obstacle as a player on a mobile device.\n    description: |\n      AutoJumpEnabled sets whether or not the Class.Humanoid will attempt to\n      automatically jump over an obstacle it is walking towards.\n\n      Currently, this property only works when the following conditions are\n      true:\n\n      - The Humanoid's character model is the Class.Player.Character of a\n        Class.Player.\n      - The Player in question is using touch controls.\n\n      When a player's character spawns, the property's value matches the\n      player's Class.Player.AutoJumpEnabled property - which in turn matches\n      the Class.StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled property.\n    codesamples:\n      - Auto-Jump-Toggle\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Jump Settings\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Humanoid.AutomaticScalingEnabled\n    summary: |\n      When Enabled, AutomaticScalingEnabled causes the size of the character to\n      change in response to the values in the humanoid's child scale values\n      changing.\n    description: |\n      The Humanoid has six child scale values including BodyDepthScale,\n      BodyHeightScale, BodyProportionScale, BodyTypeScale,\n      BodyWidthScale, HeadScale.

By default, only the torso and head\n        have Class.Part.CanCollide enabled.\n      - No state transitions or replication - The humanoid will not\n        automatically update its state. You can still set humanoid state with a\n        script, but it will not automatically replicate.\n\n      #### What does turning this off not do?\n\n      - State events - If manually setting humanoid states, the events for\n        each of the humanoid's states and\n        Class.Humanoid.StateChanged|StateChanged will still fire, which means\n        the Animate script will still receive them and animate the character\n        based on its current humanoid state.\n      - Appearance - Class.HumanoidDescription, clothes, accessories and\n        other humanoid rendering behavior.\n      - Camera and player scripts - The humanoid is still linked to\n        Class.Players and camera scripts, which ensures the camera will\n        continue to follow the Class.Humanoid.RootPart.\n      - Player input handling - The Class.Humanoid.MoveDirection property\n        will still be updated via the Class.Humanoid:Move() function and\n        Class.PlayerScripts for input.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Humanoid.FloorMaterial\n    summary: |\n      Describes the Enum.Material that the Class.Humanoid is currently\n      standing on.

It works with both regular\n      Class.BasePart|Parts and Class.Terrain voxels.\n\n      The code sample below demonstrates how to listen to when this property\n      changes using Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal().

The\n      value is restricted to the range between 0 and\n      Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth. If the humanoid is dead, this\n      property is continually set to 0.\n\n      Note that the Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()|TakeDamage() function may be\n      used to subtract from Class.Humanoid.Health|Health instead of setting\n      the property directly.\n\n      #### Health Regeneration\n\n      By default, a passive health regeneration script is automatically inserted\n      into humanoids. This causes non-dead player characters to regenerate 1% of\n      Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth each second. To disable this\n      regeneration behavior, add an empty Class.Script named Health to\n      Class.StarterCharacterScripts.\n\n      #### Health Bar Display\n\n      When Class.Humanoid.Health|Health is less than\n      Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth, a health bar is displayed\n      in-experience. The display behavior of the health bar is dependent on the\n      Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance and\n      Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType.\n\n      See\n      Character Name/Health Display\n      for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and\n      health bars.\n\n      #### Death\n\n      When the value of the character's health reaches 0, the Class.Humanoid\n      automatically transitions to the Enum.HumanoidStateType.Dead state. In\n      this state, Class.Humanoid.Health|Health is locked to 0; however, there\n      is no error or warning for setting the Class.Humanoid.Health|Health of a\n      dead humanoid to a positive nonzero value.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Game\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n      - AvatarBehavior\n  - name: Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance\n    summary: |\n      Used in conjunction with the\n      Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType|DisplayDistanceType property to\n      control the distance from which a humanoid's health bar can be seen.\n    description: |\n      This property is a number used in conjunction with the\n      Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType|DisplayDistanceType property to\n      control the distance from which a humanoid's health bar can be seen.\n\n      See\n      Character Name/Health Display\n      for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and\n      health bars.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Avatar\n  - name: Humanoid.HealthDisplayType\n    summary: |\n      Controls when the humanoid's health bar is allowed to be displayed.\n    description: |\n      This property controls when a humanoid's health bar is allowed to be\n      displayed.
