The defined\n  flex behavior overrides that of the controlling Class.UIListLayout, letting\n  you configure flex behavior on a per‑object basis where necessary.\n\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIComponent\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UIFlexItem.FlexMode\n    summary: |\n      How the parent Class.GuiObject grows or shrinks with available space in\n      the flex layout container.\n    description: |\n      Enum.UIFlexMode value which defines how the parent Class.GuiObject\n      grows or shrinks with available space in the\n      flex layout container.\n\n      When the container's size is larger than the flex line's combined\n      basis size, a value of Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow sets an effective 1:0\n      grow‑shrink ratio on the parent Class.GuiObject. Objects set to\n      Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow never shrink below their basis size, so overflow\n      may occur if the container becomes smaller than the line's combined basis\n      size.\n\n\n\n      When the container's size is smaller than the flex line's combined\n      basis size and the controlling Class.UIListLayout is not set to wrap\n      (resulting in overflow), a value of Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink sets an\n      effective 0:1 grow‑shrink ratio on the parent Class.GuiObject. Objects\n      set to Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink never grow above their basis size, so\n      underflow may occur if the container becomes larger than the line's\n      combined basis size.\n\n\n\n      When the container's size is either larger or smaller than the flex line's\n      combined basis size, a value of Enum.UIFlexMode.Fill sets an effective\n      1:1 grow‑shrink ratio on the parent Class.GuiObject. This setting\n      ensures the flex line always fills the container, even if the container\n      size changes.\n\n\n\n      For fine-tuned layouts, a value of Enum.UIFlexMode.Custom enables the\n      Class.UIFlexItem.GrowRatio|GrowRatio and\n      Class.UIFlexItem.ShrinkRatio|ShrinkRatio properties, allowing for\n      relative growth or shrinking of the object in a ratio compared to other\n      flex objects also under control of a Class.UIFlexItem.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: UIFlexMode\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIFlexItem.GrowRatio\n    summary: |\n      Determines the amount the parent Class.GuiObject grows relative to other\n      items in the line.
