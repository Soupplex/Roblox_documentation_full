This object is placed inside of a\n  Class.BasePart and the Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1 property determines\n  which other part should be welded to the original part. Two\n  Datatype.CFrame|CFrames, Class.JointInstance.C0|C0 and\n  Class.JointInstance.C1|C1, then determine how the parts should be placed.\n\n  See also Class.RigidConstraint for a newer alternative using the constraints\n  system that does not require Class.JointInstance.C0|C0 or\n  Class.JointInstance.C1|C1, but instead uses Class.Attachment|Attachments\n  to control offsets through Class.Constraint.Attachment0 and\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment1.\n\n  While the weld is Class.JointInstance.Active|Active, it maintains the part\n  positions such that:\n\n  part1.CFrame  C1 == Part0.CFrame  C0\n\n  #### Root Part\n\n  Every assembly has a root part (see Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()). When a\n  weld's Class.JointInstance.C0|C0/Class.JointInstance.C1|C1 is modified,\n  the root part will stay where it was.\n\n  #### Directionality\n\n  Welds do not have any directionality. Imagine rigid joints forming a tree,\n  branching up from the root part such that all the parts up the tree from the\n  root will move and their welded \"children\" will move with them.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - JointInstance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
