The\n  highest allowed value is 2^63-1 or around 9.2 quintillion (9.2^18). Attempting\n  to store larger numbers causes an\n  integer overflow. The lowest\n  allowed value is -2^63. Practically, however, working with integers larger\n  than 2^53 (9^15) causes loss of precision since Luau uses double-precision\n  floating-point to store numbers.\n\n  It's possible to store values between 2^53 and 2^63-1 using the\n  Properties window since it uses strings to\n  pass data to the engine, but manipulating large values via Luau scripts\n  results in loss of precision and rounding as mentioned above.\n\n  The main advantage of using IntValue lies in its rounding of values to the\n  nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from 0. For values outside of\n  this range, use Class.NumberValue instead.\n\n  Like all Class.ValueBase objects, this single value is stored in the\n  Class.IntValue.Value|Value property. The Changed event fires with the new\n  value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the\n  property being changed.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - ValueBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: IntValue.Value\n    summary: |\n      Used to hold an integer.\n    description: |\n      Used to hold an integer.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: int64\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: IntValue.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.IntValue.Value is changed.\n    description: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.IntValue.Value changes.
