This can be\n  used to highlight particular elements of audio or minimize or outright\n  eliminate others. The Class.EqualizerSoundEffect gives control over three\n  ranges of frequency: Low, Mid, and High. Their specific frequencies are as\n  follows:\n\n  - Low: 0 - 400 Hz\n  - Mid: 400 - 4000 Hz\n  - High: 4000+ Hz\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SoundEffect\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: EqualizerSoundEffect.HighGain\n    summary: |\n      The output volume of frequencies greater than 4000 Hz.\n    description: |\n      Range: -80 to 10 (default 0) The output volume of frequencies greater than\n      4000 Hz.
