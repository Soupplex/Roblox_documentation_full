For example,\n  Class.BasePart|BaseParts that are parented to the WorldModel can be\n  animated and spatially queried (for example by raycasts) but those parts are\n  not simulated. Furthermore, you can put Class.Humanoid characters in the\n  WorldModel and their joints will be set up correctly for animation.\n\n  To avoid possible performance issues, make sure to only create WorldModels\n  when you want to show them and to delete WorldModels that are currently not\n  in use.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - WorldRoot\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
