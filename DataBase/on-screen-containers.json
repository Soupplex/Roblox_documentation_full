All on‑screen UI objects and code are stored and changed on the client.\n\nFor UI containers that hold Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects that you want to display within the 3D world, such as on the face of a part, see In-Experience UI Containers.\n\nTo display a Class.ScreenGui and its child Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects to every player who joins the experience, place it inside the Class.StarterGui container. When a player joins an experience and their character first spawns, the Class.ScreenGui and its contents clone into the Class.PlayerGui container for that player, located within the Class.Players container.\n\nBy default, Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects inside a Class.ScreenGui within Class.StarterGui appear as an overlay of the 3D viewport, simulating their appearance and position in a running experience. To hide all such screen overlays, toggle off GUI overlay from the Visualization Options widget in the upper‑right corner of the 3D viewport.\n\nIf Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads is disabled, the contents of Class.StarterGui will not be cloned until Class.Player:LoadCharacter() is called.\n\nAs an experience grows in scope, you may require multiple screen interfaces such as a title screen, settings menu, shop interface, and more. In such cases, you can place multiple unique Class.ScreenGui containers inside Class.StarterGui and toggle each container's Class.ScreenGui.Enabled|Enabled property depending on whether it should be visible and active (while false, contents will not render, process user input, or update in response to changes).\n\nThe Class.ScreenGui.Enabled|Enabled property can be initially toggled through the Properties window and/or you can set it during playtime from a client‑side script by accessing the player's Class.PlayerGui and setting it to true or false for the desired container(s).\n\nWhen using multiple Class.ScreenGui interfaces, you can layer them by Z‑index through their Class.ScreenGui.DisplayOrder|DisplayOrder property. See Display Order for more information.\n\nContainer properties\n\nThe following properties let you customize the screen insets across multiple devices, the display order when using multiple screen containers, and more.\n\nScreen insets\n\nDisplay order\n\nWhen using multiple Class.ScreenGui interfaces, you can layer them by Z‑index through their Class.ScreenGui.DisplayOrder|DisplayOrder property. For example, to display a modal settings menu on one Class.ScreenGui in front of the experience's main user interface on another Class.ScreenGui, assign a higher Class.ScreenGui.DisplayOrder|DisplayOrder to the modal's than the underlying interface's.\n\nReset on spawn\n\nThe Class.ScreenGui.ResetOnSpawn|ResetOnSpawn boolean property determines if the Class.ScreenGui resets (deletes itself and re‑clones into the player's Class.PlayerGui) every time the player's character respawns.\n\n\n    Condition\n    Resets\n\n\n\n    Class.ScreenGui.ResetOnSpawn|ResetOnSpawn is true (default).\n\n\n\n    The Class.ScreenGui is an indirect descendant of Class.StarterGui; for example it's placed inside a Class.Folder located within Class.StarterGui.\n\n\n\n    Class.ScreenGui.ResetOnSpawn|ResetOnSpawn is false and the Class.ScreenGui is a direct descendant of Class.StarterGui.\n\n\n\nAccess player UI\n\nAs noted, parenting a Class.ScreenGui to Class.StarterGui clones it and its child Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects into a player's Class.PlayerGui container when they join the experience and their character first spawns.\n\nIf you need to control a player's UI container during playtime, for example to show/hide a specific Class.ScreenGui or any of its children, access it as follows from a Class.LocalScript:\n\nlua title=\"LocalScript - Accessing a Player's UI\"\nlocal Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n\nlocal player = Players.LocalPlayer\nlocal playerGui = player.PlayerGui\n\nlocal titleScreen = playerGui:WaitForChild(\"TitleScreen\")\nlocal settingsMenu = playerGui:WaitForChild(\"SettingsMenu\")\n\ntitleScreen.Enabled = false  -- Hide title screen\nsettingsMenu.Enabled = true  -- Show settings menu\n\nDisable default UI",
