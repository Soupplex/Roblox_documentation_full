For example, inserting this constraint as a\n  child of a Class.Frame and setting the constraint's\n  Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio property to 2\n  (2:1) keeps the frame's width at twice that of its height. Similarly,\n  setting this constraint's\n  Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio property to 0.5\n  (0.5:1) keeps the frame's width at half that of its height.\n\n  Setting this constraint's\n  Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio to the default of 1\n  (1:1) is a convenient way to prevent non‑proportional scaling/stretching of\n  an Class.ImageLabel with a square image asset.\n\n  Note that when a UI object is under control of both a layout structure such as\n  Class.UIListLayout and a Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint, the constraint\n  will override the layout and control the object's size.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIConstraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio\n    summary: |\n      Determines the width-to-height ratio to maintain.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the width‑to‑height ratio to maintain.
