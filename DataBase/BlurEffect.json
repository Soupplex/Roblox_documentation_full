Only\\n  one BlurEffect can be applied at once (the instance with the greatest\\n  Class.BlurEffect.Size|Size takes priority).\\n\\n  Like other post-processing effects, BlurEffect will only work while\\n  Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled and when parented to Class.Lighting or\\n  Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera. Also, it may render differently on low-end\\n  devices and/or depending on your Studio settings (see the Quality Level\\n  settings in Rendering &rarr; Performance).\\n\\n  For more details on this effect and others, see\\n  Post-Processing Effects.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - PostEffect\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: BlurEffect.Size\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the blur radius.\\n    description: |\\n      Size controls the blur radius, measured in pixels.
