Each Class.Wire connects a source and\n  target instance, and a source and target \"pin\" within each of those instances.\n  Pins are string identifiers that select which stream is to be carried by the\n  wire.\n\n  At the moment, only audio streams are supported, but this may expand in the\n  future.\n\n  The following instances may be connected by Class.Wire|Wires:\n\n  - Class.AudioAnalyzer\n  - Class.AudioChannelMixer\n  - Class.AudioChannelSplitter\n  - Class.AudioCompressor\n  - Class.AudioDeviceInput\n  - Class.AudioDeviceOutput\n  - Class.AudioDistortion\n  - Class.AudioEcho\n  - Class.AudioEmitter\n  - Class.AudioEqualizer\n  - Class.AudioFader\n  - Class.AudioFilter\n  - Class.AudioFlanger\n  - Class.AudioLimiter\n  - Class.AudioListener\n  - Class.AudioPitchShifter\n  - Class.AudioPlayer\n  - Class.AudioRecorder\n  - Class.AudioReverb\n  - Class.AudioSpeechToText\n  - Class.AudioTextToSpeech\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Wire.Connected\n    summary: |\n      Denotes whether the Class.Wire is carrying a stream of data.\n    description: |\n      Denotes whether the Class.Wire is connected, meaning its\n      Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance,\n      Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance,\n      Class.Wire.SourceName|SourceName, and Class.Wire.TargetName|TargetName\n      properties are all assigned, the corresponding\n      Class.Wire.SourceName|SourceName and Class.Wire.TargetName|TargetName\n      pins exist on Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance and\n      Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance respectively, and the\n      connection does not result in a cyclic processing graph.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Connections\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Wire.SourceInstance\n    summary: |\n      The Class.Instance producing a stream to be carried over the wire.\n    description: |\n      The Class.Instance producing a stream to be carried over the wire.
