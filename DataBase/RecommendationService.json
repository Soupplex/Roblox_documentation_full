It supports creating, retrieving,\n  updating, and deleting recommendation items, as well as generating lists of\n  recommended content for users. Additionally, it includes functionality for\n  logging user interactions, such as views and actions, to help refine and\n  improve recommendation quality. Once set up, you can monitor analytics in the\n  Creator Dashboard under the Engagement section for an experience.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: RecommendationService:GenerateItemListAsync\n    summary: ''\n    description: |\n      This function returns a paginated list of recommended items based on a\n      given request. The request can specify criteria such as configuration\n      name, location, and page size to tailor the recommendations. It returns a\n      Class.RecommendationPages object that can be used to iterate through the\n      list of items.\n\n      The ConfigName parameter determines how the recommendation engine ranks\n      and returns items. For example, you can have configurations that optimize\n      for views, likes, or purchases. For the ranking to be effective, you must\n      ensure that you are logging the corresponding user interactions using\n      Class.RecommendationService.LogImpressionEvent|LogImpressionEvent and\n      Class.RecommendationService.LogActionEvent|LogActionEvent.\n\n      Supported ConfigName are:\n\n      - MaximizeTimespent: Optimizes recommendations to prioritize content\n        that engages users for longer periods.\n      - MaximizeReactions: Optimizes recommendations to highlight content that\n        generates the most user reactions, such as likes and favorites.\n      - MaximizePlays: Optimizes recommendations to prioritize content that\n        generates the most Play actions. To use this configuration\n        effectively, you must log both impressions and Play actions. It's\n        recommended to filter for \"quality\" plays (for example play duration\n        greater than 60 seconds) before logging to reduce noise and improve the\n        system's learning accuracy.\n      - MaximizeEngagement: Optimizes recommendations through a balanced\n        approach that considers multiple engagement signals, including quality\n        views and reactions. This config is designed to highlight content that\n        performs well across different engagement areas.\n      - PlayerSpecific: Returns public items created by the player specified\n        in the request and sorted by the most recent creation time. To use this\n        config, you must pass the UserId in the CustomContexts.\n      - RecentlyAdded: Returns items sorted by how recent they are, and\n        displays the most recently added public content first.\n      - MaximizeJoins: (Coming soon) Optimizes recommendations to prioritize\n        game joins. This configuration is currently exclusive to Roblox Moments\n        and focuses on maximizing interactions leading to a teleport. In\n        contrast, MaximizePlays is purely optimizing Play actions.\n      - PlayerOwnedItems: Displays the user's own creations sorted by creation\n        time. This config requires user authentication because it displays\n        private items. This config is only available on the client.\n\n      This function can be called from both the server and the client.\n      When called from the server, you must pass the UserId in the\n      CustomContexts.\n    codesamples:\n      - GenerateItemListAsync-example\n    parameters:\n      - name: generateRecommendationItemListRequest\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A dictionary containing the following fields:\n\n          - ConfigName &mdash; A unique ID for the specific configuration.\n            This determines how the candidates are ranked.\n          - LocationId &mdash; A developer-defined string that specifies the\n            location where the recommendation is used, such as \"Foryou\" or\n            \"Lobby\". This parameter will not affect the items returned, and it\n            can help you track the performance of multiple recommendation\n            features within your experience. Recommendation metrics for each\n            individual location will be displayed in the Creator Hub.\n            LocationId must be a string and cannot be \"Other\" or\n            \"other\" as these values are reserved by the Creator Hub.\n          - PageSize &mdash; The number of items returned for each page.\n          - BoostCustomTags &mdash; A list of string tags.

It\n      requires a player object and a registerRecommendationItemsRequest\n      dictionary containing details about the item, such as its content type,\n      reference ID, and custom tags. It returns a dictionary with the ItemId\n      and the ReferenceId of the newly registered item.\n\n      When selecting a ContentType, choose the type that best represents your\n      item. Note that different content types are not ranked against each other\n      directly. Instead, they are mixed into the final recommendation list based\n      on a configured ratio. For example, a configuration might display one\n      Static item for every ten items. If your experience only features a\n      single type of content, ensure that all registered items share the same\n      ContentType.\n\n      The ItemId is a unique ID returned by the RecommendationService. All\n      functions in the RecommendationService use the ItemId as input and\n      output.\n\n      The ReferenceId is a developer-provided identifier for an item. To make\n      sure that this reference ID is unique, we recommend that you use a UUID.\n      You can use this reference ID as a key to store rendering-specific\n      metadata in a data store.\n\n      When you register an item, you should only provide information that is\n      relevant for ranking and recommendations. All other data needed for\n      rendering should be stored separately in, for example, a data store. This\n      approach decouples the recommendation logic from the rendering process,\n      and results in a system that is more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n      Attributes is a list of content attributes associated with the item.\n      Each attribute in the list can contain the following fields:\n\n      - AssetId &mdash; The ID of an asset, such as an image or video.\n      - Text &mdash; A short text string, like a title.\n      - Description &mdash; A longer text description for the attribute.\n      - SeekStartTime / SeekEndTime &mdash; The start and end times for\n        seeking within video content.\n      - TrimStartTime / TrimEndTime &mdash; The start and end times for\n        trimming video content.\n\n      Common Error Codes:\n\n      - HTTP 403 (Forbidden) &mdash; This error can occur when you call\n        RegisterItemAsync from Studio. Even if you run it as a server script\n        in Studio, the request is not issued from a Roblox server. To resolve\n        this, publish your experience and run it in the Roblox client.\n      - HTTP 400 (Bad Request) &mdash; This error indicates that a parameter\n        is malformed. A common cause is the Attributes table exceeding its\n        size limit. If you encounter a 400 error and have a large Attributes\n        table, try reducing its size. Remember to only include attributes that\n        are relevant for ranking.\n\n      This function can only be called from the server.\n    codesamples:\n      - RegisterItemAsync-example\n    parameters:\n      - name: player\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The player who created the item.\n      - name: registerRecommendationItemsRequest\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A dictionary containing the following fields:\n\n          - ContentType &mdash; The Enum.RecommendationItemContentType\n            specifying the type of content.
