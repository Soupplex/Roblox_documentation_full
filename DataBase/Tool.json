For players,\n  they are stored in a Class.Backpack object parented to a Class.Player\n  object. In-experience, players may have multiple tools which appear as icons\n  at the bottom of the screen. Equipping a tool moves it from the\n  Class.Backpack and into a Class.Player.Character model in the\n  Class.Workspace. By default, tools are held in the right hand and have a\n  handle in them, which is a Class.BasePart named Handle inside (although\n  one isn't required if Class.Tool.RequiresHandle is false). Tools that are\n  to be provided to (re)spawning players should be stored in the\n  Class.StarterPack.\ncodesamples:\n  - Explode-Tool-Example\n  - Sword-Tool-Example\ninherits:\n  - BackpackItem\ndescendants:\n  - Flag\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Tool.CanBeDropped\n    summary: |\n      Controls whether the player can drop the tool.\n    description: |\n      The CanBeDropped property controls whether the player can drop the\n      Class.Tool.\n\n      If true, when the backspace button is pressed, the tool will be parented\n      to Class.Workspace and removed from the player's Class.Backpack.
