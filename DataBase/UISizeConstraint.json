For example, if\n  Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize|MaxSize is set to\n  (200, 200) and\n  Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize to (100, 100), the constrained object cannot scale to be\n  larger than 200&times;200 pixels or smaller than 100&times;100 pixels.\n\n  Note that if the object with this constraint is also under the control of a\n  Class.UILayout such as Class.UIGridLayout, the constraint determines\n  the object's minimum/maximum size and overwrites any size the layout would\n  apply.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIConstraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UISizeConstraint.MaxSize\n    summary: |\n      The largest size, in pixels, the parent object is allowed to be.\n    description: |\n      The largest size, in pixels, the parent object is allowed to be.
