The input and output values are both\n      arrays.\n\n      - The order of the user info objects in the return value's array may not\n        match the order of the Class.Player.UserId|UserIds sent in the input\n        parameter's array. Use the Id field of the user info object to\n        identify your input array with the output array.\n      - It's possible to receive fewer user info objects than requested if one\n        or more of the Class.Player.UserId|UserIds in the request array are\n        invalid, such as negative numbers or user IDs that don't have accounts\n        associated with them. It's possible to receive a response with zero\n        results if all Class.Player.UserId|UserIds are invalid.\n      - If a Roblox user does not have a Class.Player.DisplayName|DisplayName\n        associated with their account, this function will instead return the\n        same string as the user's username in their info object's DisplayName\n        field. While a user's Class.Player.UserId|UserId will never change,\n        they may change their username or display name, so the same input\n        Class.Player.UserId|UserIds may return a different string for these\n        fields from one day to another.\n      - Since\n        Class.UserService:GetUserInfosByUserIdsAsync()|GetUserInfosByUserIdsAsync()\n        makes an external web request, it will yield and may fail if the backend\n        service is experiencing interruptions. Ensure you can handle downtime\n        appropriately by wrapping this method with a\n        Global.LuaGlobals.pcall().\n      - Results are limited to 250 per minute, so if you receive an HTTP 429\n        error, try again later, ideally after reducing the number of\n        Class.Player.UserId|UserIds in your input array, reducing the number\n        of method calls, or both.\n\n      The signature of a singular user info object is:\n\n\n\n\n        Key\n        Type\n        Description\n\n\n\n\n        Id\n        number\n        The\n        Class.Player.UserId|UserId associated with the user.\n\n\n        Username\n        string\n        The username associated with the user.\n\n\n        DisplayName\n        string\n        The\n        Class.Player.DisplayName|DisplayName associated with the\n        user.\n\n\n        HasVerifiedBadge\n        boolean\n        The\n        Class.Player.HasVerifiedBadge|HasVerifiedBadge value\n        associated with the user.\n\n\n\n    codesamples:\n      - userservice-getuserinfosbyuseridsasync-example\n    parameters:\n      - name: userIds\n        type: Array\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          An array of Class.Player.UserId|UserIds requested.\n    returns:\n      - type: Array\n        summary: |\n          An array of dictionary objects that contain user information.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
