It provides a single Input pin but does not\n  produce any output streams. Note that all audio processing is disabled on the\n  server in order to conserve resources; Properties and methods of\n  Class.AudioAnalyzer return empty or zero results when used from server\n  scripts.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AudioAnalyzer.PeakLevel\n    summary: |\n      The loudest volume observed during the last audio buffer.\n    description: |\n      The loudest volume observed during the last audio buffer.
