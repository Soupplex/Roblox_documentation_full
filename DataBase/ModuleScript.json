Returns exactly one value, usually a table of functions, to used by other\n  scripts. Useful for compartmentalizing code.\ndescription: |\n  A Class.ModuleScript is a script type that returns exactly one value by a\n  call to Global.LuaGlobals.require(). Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts run\n  once and only once per Luau environment and return the exact same value for\n  subsequent calls to Global.LuaGlobals.require().\n\n  Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts are essential objects for adhering to the\n  \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle, allowing you to write a function only\n  once and use it everywhere. Having multiple copies of a function is\n  problematic when you need to change their behavior, so you should define\n  functions or groups of functions in Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts and\n  have your Class.Script|Scripts and Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts call\n  Global.LuaGlobals.require() on those modules.\n\n  It's important to know that return values from\n  Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts are independent with regards to\n  Class.Script|Scripts and Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts, and other\n  environments like the\n  Command Bar. Using\n  Global.LuaGlobals.require() on a Class.ModuleScript in a\n  Class.LocalScript will run the code on the client, even if a Class.Script\n  did so already on the server. Therefore, be careful if you're using a\n  Class.ModuleScript on the client and server at the same time, or debugging\n  it within Studio.\n\n  Note that the first call to Global.LuaGlobals.require() will not yield\n  (halt) unless the Class.ModuleScript yields (calls Library.task.wait() for\n  example), in which case the current thread that called\n  Global.LuaGlobals.require() will yield until the Class.ModuleScript\n  returns a value. If a Class.ModuleScript is attempting to\n  Global.LuaGlobals.require() another Class.ModuleScript that in turn tries\n  to Global.LuaGlobals.require() it, the thread will hang and never halt\n  (cyclic Global.LuaGlobals.require() calls do not generate errors). Be\n  mindful of your module dependencies in large projects!\n\n  If a Class.ModuleScript is uploaded to Roblox and the root module has the\n  name set to MainModule, it can be uploaded as a model and required using\n  Global.LuaGlobals.require() with the model's asset ID. Then it can be loaded\n  into your experience, although this logic only works on the server and will\n  error on the client. If other users want to use the module, it must be public.\ncodesamples:\n  - Simple-ModuleScript-Example\n  - Simple-ModuleScript-Usage\ninherits:\n  - LuaSourceContainer\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ModuleScript.LinkedSource\n    summary: |\n      Used to store a URL that points to an online script source.
