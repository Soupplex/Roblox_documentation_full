Also, it may render differently depending on\\n  your Studio settings (see Editor Quality Level in\\n  Rendering).\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - PostEffect\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: ColorCorrectionEffect.Brightness\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines by how much the brightness of pixel colors will be shifted.\\n    description: |\\n      This property determines by how much the colors of pixels will be shifted.\\n      A value of -1 will cause all pixels to be completely black while a value\\n      of 1 will cause them to be white.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: State\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: ColorCorrectionEffect.Contrast\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the change in separation between the dark and light colors.\\n    description: |\\n      This property determines the separation between the dark and light colors.\\n      Values less than 0 have reduced contrast while values greater than 0\\n      have increased contrast.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: State\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: ColorCorrectionEffect.Saturation\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the change in intensity of colors.\\n    description: |\\n      This property determines the change in intensity of pixel colors.
