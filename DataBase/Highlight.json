Every highlight effect\n  has a silhouette outline that surrounds the object and a solid overlay\n  interior that displays over the object. You can customize both of these\n  components independently to modify the highlight's visual appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Base object\n\n\n\n\n\n          White outline, 50% red interior\n\n\n\n\n\n          Yellow outline, black interior\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Useful applications of the highlight effect include:\n\n  - Providing visual feedback that an object is important and/or interactable.\n  - Making distant objects visible through objects that are closer to the user.\n  - Indicating the current position and status of other characters.\n\n  #### Limitations\n\n  As a performance limit, Studio only displays 255 simultaneous\n  Class.Highlight instances on the client at a time. If you exceed this limit,\n  the additional instances are silently ignored. Note that while a\n  Class.Highlight with Class.Highlight.Enabled|Enabled set to false\n  doesn't display, it still takes one of the 255 available slots, so if you plan\n  to permanently disable a Class.Highlight instance, it's best to delete it\n  rather than disable it.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Highlight.Adornee\n    summary: |\n      The Class.Instance that the Class.Highlight is applied to.\n    description: |\n      The Class.Instance for which to apply the Class.Highlight, used to\n      apply the effect to an Class.Instance outside of a child/parent\n      relationship.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Instance\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Highlight.DepthMode\n    summary: |\n      Controls how the Class.Highlight effect displays with respect to other\n      objects in the world.\n    description: |\n      Controls how the Class.Highlight effect displays with respect to other\n      objects in the world.
