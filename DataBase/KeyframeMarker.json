These\n  events are identifiable by the name of the KeyframeMarker. You can retrieve\n  and listen to these events using the\n  Class.AnimationTrack.GetKeyframeMarkerReached function. Optionally, you may\n  set the Class.KeyframeMarker.Value property of the KeyframeMarker in order\n  to pass along a value with the event being fired.\n\n  It inherits the Class.Instance.Name|Keyframe.Name property from\n  Class.Instance and behaves identically. Names are used for identification\n  and do not need to be unique. When multiple KeyframeMarker instances with\n  the same name are attached to a Class.Keyframe, events such as the one\n  returned by Class.AnimationTrack:GetMarkerReachedSignal() will fire for\n  every marker.\n\n  See also:\n\n  - Class.Keyframe, holds the Class.Pose|Poses applied to joints in a\n    Class.Model at a given point of time in an animation\n  - Class.AnimationTrack, controls the playback of an animation on a\n    Class.Humanoid or Class.AnimationController\n  - Class.Animation, holds a reference to animation data required to play\n    custom animations on characters or other models using the Roblox animation\n    system\ncodesamples:\n  - get-keyframe-markers-attached-to-a-keyframe\n  - listening-to-keyframemarkers\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: KeyframeMarker.Value\n    summary: |\n      A value that is specified for a Class.KeyframeMarker.\n    description: |\n      A value that is specified for a Class.KeyframeMarker.
