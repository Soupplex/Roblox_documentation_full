    "content": "A Datatype.CFrame, short for Coordinate Frame, is a data type used to rotate and position 3D objects. As either an object property or a standalone unit, a Datatype.CFrame contains global X, Y, and Z coordinates as well as rotation data for each axis. In addition, Datatype.CFrame|CFrames contain helpful functions for working with objects in the 3D space.\n\nPosition a CFrame\n\nYou can create an empty Datatype.CFrame at the default position of (0, 0, 0) by using Datatype.CFrame.new(). To position a Datatype.CFrame at a specific point, provide X, Y, and Z coordinates as arguments to Datatype.CFrame.new(). In the following example, the redBlock part's Datatype.CFrame property changes to newCFrame, repositioning it to (-2, 2, 4).\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\n\n-- Create new CFrame\nlocal newCFrame = CFrame.new(-2, 2, 4)\n\n-- Overwrite the red block's current CFrame with the new CFrame\nredBlock.CFrame = newCFrame\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nAlternatively, you can provide a new Datatype.Vector3 position to Datatype.CFrame.new() and achieve the same result:\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\n\n-- Create new CFrame\nlocal newVector3 = Vector3.new(-2, 2, 4)\nlocal newCFrame = CFrame.new(newVector3)\n\n-- Overwrite the red block's current CFrame with the new CFrame\nredBlock.CFrame = newCFrame\n\nRotate a CFrame\n\nTo create a rotated Datatype.CFrame, use the Datatype.CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ() constructor, providing a rotation angle in radians for the desired axes. The parameters to Datatype.CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ() are in radians, not degrees; if you prefer degrees, use Library.math.rad() to convert degrees to radians. In the following example, the redBlock part rotates 45 degrees counterclockwise on its Y axis.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\n\n-- Create new rotated CFrame\nlocal newCFrame = CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ(0, math.rad(45), 0)\n\n-- Overwrite the red block's current CFrame with the new CFrame\nredBlock.CFrame = newCFrame\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nFace a CFrame toward a point\n\nYou can use Datatype.CFrame.lookAt() to point the front surface of a Datatype.CFrame at a specific point in the world. The following example positions redBlock at (0, 3, 0) and points its front surface, marked by the white circle, at the blueCube part.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\nlocal blueCube = Workspace.BlueCube\n\nredBlock.Position = Vector3.new(0, 3, 0)\n\n-- Point the front surface of the red block at the blue cube\nredBlock.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(redBlock.Position, blueCube.Position)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nOffset a CFrame\n\nTo offset an object by a specific number of studs from its current position, add or subtract a Datatype.Vector3 to or from a new Datatype.CFrame at the object's position. To get a properly-formatted Datatype.Vector3 position of an object to use with Datatype.CFrame.new(), as seen here, its Class.BasePart.Position|Position property (redBlock.Position) is a convenient shortcut.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\n\nredBlock.CFrame = CFrame.new(redBlock.Position) + Vector3.new(0, 1.25, 0)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nYou can use the same technique to offset an object from the position of another object. In the following example, a Datatype.Vector3 adds to a new Datatype.CFrame created at the blue cube's position instead of the block's position.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\nlocal blueCube = Workspace.BlueCube\n\nredBlock.CFrame = CFrame.new(blueCube.Position) + Vector3.new(0, 2, 0)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nDynamic CFrame orientation\n\nThe Datatype.CFrame.new() and Datatype.CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ() constructors reposition or rotate an object at a specific orientation within the world, but you sometimes can't rely on a fixed world position and rotation angle. For example:\n\n- Placing a floating treasure directly in front of a player who may be standing anywhere in the world, facing any direction.\n- Making a magical genie appear directly above a player's right shoulder.\n\nIn these cases, use Datatype.CFrame methods instead of their constructors.\n\nRelative position\n\nThe Datatype.CFrame:ToWorldSpace() function transforms an object's Datatype.CFrame &mdash; respecting its own local orientation &mdash; to a new world orientation. This makes it ideal for offsetting a part relative to itself or another object, regardless of how it's currently positioned/rotated.\n\nIn the following example, the redBlock part offsets 2 studs relative to the Y axis of the blue cube (the green arrow pointing through it) and not relative to the global Y axis pointing straight up.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\nlocal blueCube = Workspace.BlueCube\n\nlocal offsetCFrame = CFrame.new(0, 2, 0)\nredBlock.CFrame = blueCube.CFrame:ToWorldSpace(offsetCFrame)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nRelative rotation\n\nYou can also use Datatype.CFrame:ToWorldSpace() to rotate an object relative to itself. In the following example, the redBlock part rotates 70 degrees counterclockwise on its Y axis and 20 degrees clockwise on its Z axis.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\n\nlocal rotatedCFrame = CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ(0, math.rad(70), math.rad(20))\nredBlock.CFrame = redBlock.CFrame:ToWorldSpace(rotatedCFrame)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nFace a specific surface toward a point\n\nYou can make the front of an object face another object by supplying a Datatype.Vector3 point as the second parameter of Datatype.CFrame.new(). You can also use relative rotation to make any face of the object point toward a Datatype.Vector3 point. The following example performs two consecutive Datatype.CFrame operations:\n\n1. Point the front surface, marked by the white circle, at the target.\n2. Rotate the Datatype.CFrame to make the top surface, marked by the black circle, point toward the target.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\nlocal blueCube = Workspace.BlueCube\n\n-- Point the red block's front surface at the blue cube\nredBlock.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(redBlock.Position, blueCube.Position)\n\n-- Rotate CFrame relative to itself so that top surface (not front) points toward blue cube\nlocal rotatedCFrame = CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ(math.rad(-90), 0, 0)\nredBlock.CFrame = redBlock.CFrame:ToWorldSpace(rotatedCFrame)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After\n\n\nFind a point between points\n\nYou can use linear interpolation, or lerp, to position a Datatype.CFrame between two points. In the following example, the redBlock part repositions between the greenCube and cyanCube parts. The value of 0.7 places it 70% of the distance away from the green cube.\n\nlua\nlocal Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\nlocal redBlock = Workspace.RedBlock\nlocal greenCube = Workspace.GreenCube\nlocal cyanCube = Workspace.CyanCube\n\nredBlock.CFrame = greenCube.CFrame:Lerp(cyanCube.CFrame, 0.7)\n\n\n\n    Before\n\n\n\n    After",
