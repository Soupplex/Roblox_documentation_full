Like the others, it\n  emits particles when parented to a Class.BasePart or an Class.Attachment\n  while Class.Fire.Enabled|Enabled. This object is useful to create a quick\n  visual effect for fire, but for more detailed work it's recommended that you\n  use a Class.ParticleEmitter instead.\n\n  Particles emit from the center of the parent in an upward (+Y) direction,\n  but a negative Class.Fire.Heat|Heat value may be used to emit particles\n  downward (-Y). Using an Class.Attachment as the parent instead of a\n  Class.BasePart allows for the emission position/direction to be modified by\n  changing the Class.Attachment.CFrame or related properties.\n\n  Class.Fire objects consist of two emitters, each affected in various ways by\n  the Class.Fire.Size|Size, Class.Fire.Heat|Heat, Class.Fire.Color|Color,\n  and Class.Fire.SecondaryColor|SecondaryColor properties. Particles which\n  emit from the smaller, secondary emitter have a significantly longer lifetime\n  (and rise farther) than those emitted by the primary emitter.\n\n  When Class.Fire.Enabled|Enabled is off, existing particles continue to\n  render until they expire. However, if the Class.Fire object's\n  Class.Instance.Parent|Parent is set to nil, all existing particles\n  immediately disappear, similar to the behavior of\n  Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear().\n\n  Class.Fire objects emit no light on their own. To help create a cohesive\n  environment around a burning object, try adding a Class.PointLight with an\n  orange Class.Light.Color|Color.\ncodesamples:\n  - Lighting-Torches\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Fire.Color\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color of the primary (outer) flame particles.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the color of the larger particles emitted by a\n      Class.Fire object. It is essentially the color of the outer portion of\n      the flame.\n\n      In general, the cooler flames are on the outside of a fire. Therefore,\n      fire looks more realistic if the outer portions are red or orange-yellow.\n      A fire that is bright all throughout doesn't look very realistic, so avoid\n      setting this property to yellow or white.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Color3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Fire.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether flame particles are emit.\n    description: |\n      This property, much like Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled, determines\n      whether flame particles are emitted. Any particles already emitted will\n      continue to render until their lifetime expires.\n\n      Since all fire particles are destroyed when the Class.Fire object's\n      Class.Instance.Parent|Parent is set to nil, this property is useful in\n      allowing existing particles the opportunity to expire before destroying\n      the Class.Fire object altogether (see the code example below).\n\n\n      local Debris = game:GetService(\"Debris\")\n\n      local function douseFlames(fire)\n      \tfire.Enabled = false -- No more new particles\n      \tDebris:AddItem(fire, 2) -- Remove the object after existing particles have expired\n      end\n\n      douseFlames(part.Fire)\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Fire.Heat\n    summary: |\n      Determines the velocity at which particles are emit.\n    description: |\n      This property determines how fast particles are emitted from the\n      Class.Fire object.

Positive values are in the top (+Y) direction of the parent\n      Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment, while negative values are in the\n      downward (-Y) direction.

It is essentially the color of the inner portion of\n      the flame.\n\n      Note that the inner particles use a Class.ParticleEmitter.LightEmission\n      of 1, so darker colors will instead cause the particles to appear\n      transparent, and black will stop rendering inner particles altogether.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Color3\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Fire.Size\n    summary: |\n      Determines the size of the flame particles.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the size of the flame particles.
