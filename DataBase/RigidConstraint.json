This flexibility gives it additional\n  functionality beyond Class.WeldConstraint, such as attaching accessories to\n  Class.Attachment|Attachments on a character rig.\n\n  The fastest way to create this constraint is by selecting\n  Rigid Constraint through Studio's Create menu in the toolbar's\n  Model tab.\n\n  Note that this tool behaves differently depending on whether you click on\n  existing Class.BasePart|BaseParts, Class.Attachment|Attachments, or\n  Class.Bone|Bones after the tool is activated:\n\n  - Clicking on an existing Class.BasePart creates a new Class.Attachment\n    upon it as the intended Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment0 or\n    Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment1.\n  - Clicking on an existing Class.Attachment or Class.Bone uses that\n    instance as the intended Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment0 or\n    Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment1.\n\n  Following the second valid click, a new Class.RigidConstraint is created to\n  connect the two new attachments. If either the first or second click is\n  not made on a Class.BasePart, Class.Attachment, or Class.Bone, the\n  workflow is canceled and no constraint is created.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
