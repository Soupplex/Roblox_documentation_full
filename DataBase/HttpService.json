This service allows experiences to\n  be integrated with third-party web services such as analytics, data storage,\n  remote server configuration, error reporting, advanced calculations, or\n  real-time communication. Additionally, it can call a subset of the Open Cloud\n  APIs.\n\n  For more information about these use cases, see\n  In-experience HTTP requests.\n\n  HttpService also houses the Class.HttpService:JSONEncode()|JSONEncode and\n  Class.HttpService:JSONDecode()|JSONDecode methods, which are useful for\n  communicating with services that use the JSON format. In\n  addition, the Class.HttpService:GenerateGUID()|GenerateGUID method provides\n  random 128‑bit labels which can be treated as probabilistically unique in a\n  variety of scenarios.\n\n  Within Studio, use\n  Class.HttpService:CreateWebStreamClient()|CreateWebStreamClient() to process\n  data in real time from servers that support streaming protocols such as\n  SSE,\n  chunked transfer encoding,\n  and WebSockets. You can connect\n  callback functions to stream events, allowing you to process data immediately\n  as it arrives instead of waiting for the entire response to complete.\n\n  Only send HTTP requests to trusted third-party platforms to avoid introducing\n  unnecessary security risks to your experience.\ncodesamples:\n  - Astronauts-in-Space\n  - International-Space-Station\n  - HttpService-Pastebin\n  - OpenCloud-via-HttpService\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: HttpService.HttpEnabled\n    summary: |\n      Indicates whether HTTP requests can be sent to external websites.\n    description: |\n      When set to true, allows scripts to send requests to websites using\n      Class.HttpService:GetAsync(), Class.HttpService:PostAsync(), and\n      Class.HttpService:RequestAsync().\n\n      This property must be toggled on through the\n      Experience Settings interface in\n      Studio, or for unpublished experiences by setting this property to\n      true using the\n      Command Bar:\n\n      game:GetService(\"HttpService\").HttpEnabled = true\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: LocalUserSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Network\nmethods:\n  - name: HttpService:CreateWebStreamClient\n    summary: |\n      Creates a client that opens a persistent connection to stream data.\n    description: |\n      This method creates a client that establishes a long-lived connection to\n      servers utilizing various streaming technologies, such as\n      Server-Sent Events (SSE).\n      After the connection is established, the client fires signals that you can\n      connect callback functions to with Datatype.RBXScriptConnection. Use\n      these callbacks to process messages as soon as they arrive, as well as\n      respond to open, close, and error events.\n\n      There is a limit of six total clients allowed at one time. Close streams\n      that you no longer need with Class.WebStreamClient:Close(). When the\n      stream is no longer needed, you should disconnect any associated\n      Datatype.RBXScriptConnection|RBXScriptConnections to avoid memory leaks.\n\n      This method is available in Studio only. If you use it inside scripts,\n      make sure to remove any references before publishing the experience.

The sixteen octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal\n      (base 16) digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens in\n      the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters, for example\n      123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000.\n\n      The UUID specification used is\n      [Version 4 (random)](),\n      variant 1 (DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996). UUIDs of this version are the\n      most commonly used due to their simplicity, as they are entirely randomly\n      generated. Note that this version does not have certain features that\n      other UUID versions have, such as encoded timestamps, MAC addresses, or\n      time-based sorting like UUIDv7 or\n      ULID.\n\n      There are over 5.3&times;1036 unique v4 UUIDs, in which the\n      probability of finding a duplicate within 103 trillion UUIDs is one in a\n      billion.\n\n      The wrapInCurlyBraces argument determines whether the returned string is\n      wrapped in curly braces ({}).

It returns a dictionary that describes the response data received.\n      Optionally, the request can be compressed using Enum.HttpCompression.\n\n      ##### Request dictionary fields\n\n\n\n\n                  Name\n                  Type\n                  Required\n                  Description\n\n\n\n\n                  Url\n                  String\n                  yes\n                  The target URL for this request. Must use http or https protocols.\n\n\n                  Method\n                  String\n                  no\n                  The HTTP method being used by this request, most often GET or POST.\n\n\n                  Headers\n                  Dictionary\n                  no\n                  A dictionary of headers to be used with this request. Most HTTP headers are accepted here, but not all.\n\n\n                  Body\n                  String\n                  no\n                  The request body. Can be any string, including binary data. Must be excluded when using the GET or HEAD HTTP methods. It might be necessary to specify the Content-Type header when sending JSON or other formats.\n\n\n                  Compress\n                  Enum.HttpCompression\n                  no\n                  An optional compression field that will compress the data in the request. The value can either be Enum.HttpCompression.None or Enum.HttpCompression.Gzip.\n\n\n                  Timeout\n                  Integer\n                  no\n                  An optional timeout value in seconds to make requests time out more quickly. Values must be greater than zero and no greater than the default request timeout. This can be useful when debugging hanging requests.\n\n\n\n\n      ##### Supported HTTP methods\n\n      The HTTP request methods specify the purpose of the request being made and\n      what is expected if the request is successful. For instance, the GET\n      request method tells the server at the requested address that a resource\n      is being requested and, if it succeeds, the resource at that address will\n      be returned. Similarly, the HEAD request method does the same except the\n      server knows to return a response without a Body element.\n\n\n\n\n                  Method\n                  Description\n                  Safe\n\n\n\n\n                  GET  &#9432;\n                  The GET method requests the resource at the specified address. Does not support use of the Body parameter.\n                  Yes\n\n\n                  HEAD  &#9432;\n                  The HEAD method requests a response identical to a GET request, but with no response body. Does not support use of the Body parameter.\n                  Yes\n\n\n                  POST  &#9432;\n                  The POST method submits the supplied Body data to the requested address.\n                  No\n\n\n                  PUT  &#9432;\n                  The PUT method replaces all current iterations of the resource specified within the supplied Body data.\n                  No\n\n\n                  DELETE  &#9432;\n                  The DELETE method deletes the resource specified in the supplied Body data at the requested address.\n                  No\n\n\n                  OPTIONS  &#9432;\n                  The OPTIONS method requests the permitted communication options for the supplied address.\n                  Yes\n\n\n                  TRACE  &#9432;\n                  The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the resource specified in the supplied Body data.\n                  Yes\n\n\n                  PATCH  &#9432;\n                  The PATCH method applies partial changes to the resource specified in the supplied Body data at the requested address.\n                  No\n\n\n\n\n      ##### HTTP headers\n\n      In the request dictionary, you can specify custom HTTP headers to use in\n      the request. However, some headers cannot be specified. For example,\n      Content-Length is determined from the request body. User-Agent and\n      Roblox-Id are locked by Roblox. Other headers like Accept or\n      Cache-Control use default values but can be overridden. More commonly,\n      some REST APIs may require API keys or other service authentication to be\n      specified in request headers.\n\n      The RequestAsync() method does not detect the format of body content.\n      Many web servers require the Content-Type header be set appropriately\n      when sending certain formats. Other methods of Class.HttpService use the\n      Enum.HttpContentType enum; for this method set the Content-Type header\n      appropriately: text/plain, text/xml, application/xml,\n      application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded are replacement\n      Content-Type header values for the respective enum values.\n\n      ##### Response dictionary fields\n\n      RequestAsync() returns a dictionary containing the following fields:\n\n\n\n\n                  Name\n                  Type\n                  Description\n\n\n\n\n                  Success\n                  Boolean\n                  The success status of the request. This is true if and only if the StatusCode lies within the range 200-299.\n\n\n                  StatusCode\n                  Integer\n                  The HTTP response code identifying the status of the response.\n\n\n                  StatusMessage\n                  String\n                  The status message that was sent back.\n\n\n                  Headers\n                  Dictionary\n                  A dictionary of headers that were set in this response.\n\n\n                  Body\n\n                  The request body (content) received in the response.\n\n\n\n\n      ##### Error Cases\n\n      RequestAsync() raises an error if the response times out or if the\n      target server rejects the request. If a web service goes down for some\n      reason, it can cause scripts that use this method to stop functioning\n      altogether. It is often a good idea to wrap calls to this method in\n      Global.LuaGlobals.pcall() and gracefully handle failure cases if the\n      required information isn't available.\n\n      ##### Limitations\n\n      The current limitation for sending and receiving external HTTP\n      requests is 500 requests per minute. There is also a separate limit of\n      2500 requests per minute for\n      Open Cloud requests.\n      Requests over these thresholds will fail.\n    codesamples:\n      - sending-an-http-request\n      - OpenCloud-via-HttpService\n    parameters:\n      - name: requestOptions\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          A dictionary containing information to be requested from the server\n          specified.\n    returns:\n      - type: Dictionary\n        summary: |\n          A dictionary containing response information from the server\n          specified.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Network\n  - name: HttpService:UrlEncode\n    summary: |\n      Replaces URL-unsafe characters with '%' and two hexadecimal characters.\n    description: |\n      This method\n      percent-encodes a given\n      string so that reserved characters properly encoded with % and two\n      hexadecimal characters.\n\n      This is useful when formatting URLs for use with\n      Class.HttpService:GetAsync()/Class.HttpService:PostAsync(), or POST\n      data of the media type application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n      (Enum.HttpContentType|Enum.HttpContentType.ApplicationUrlEncoded).\n\n      For instance, when you encode the URL https://www.roblox.com/discover#/,\n      this method returns https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eroblox%2Ecom%2Fdiscover%23%2F.\n    codesamples:\n      - HttpService-UrlEncode\n      - HttpService-Pastebin\n    parameters:\n      - name: input\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The string (URL) to encode.\n    returns:\n      - type: string\n        summary: |\n          The encoded string.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Safe\n    capabilities:\n      - Network\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
