Scripts invoking a Class.RemoteFunction yield until\n  they receive a response from the recipient.\ndescription: |\n  The RemoteFunction object facilitates synchronous, two-way communication\n  across the client-server boundary. You\n  can use it to define a custom callback function and invoke it manually by\n  calling Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeClient() or\n  Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer(). The code invoking the function\n  yields until it receives a response from the recipient.\n\n  In order for both the server and clients to access a Class.RemoteFunction\n  instance, it must be in a place where both sides can see it, such as\n  Class.ReplicatedStorage, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it\n  in Class.Workspace or inside a Class.Tool.\n\n  If the result is not needed, it is recommended that you use a\n  Class.RemoteEvent instead, since its call is asynchronous and doesn't need\n  to wait for a response to continue execution. See\n  Remote Events and Callbacks for code\n  samples and further details on Class.RemoteFunction.\n\n  #### Streaming Precautions\n\n  Note that if an invoked Class.RemoteFunction creates an instance on the\n  server, there is no guarantee that it exists on the client when the function\n  returns. This is particularly important in places where instance\n  streaming is enabled and when the created\n  instances are Class.BasePart|BaseParts or Class.Model|Models, since parts\n  that are far away from the player's character may not be streamed to the\n  client, and models that are Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Atomic depend on whether\n  their parts are streamed. Even if a model is\n  Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Persistent, there may be some delay between the\n  creation of the model and when it is replicated to the client.\n\n  #### Parameter Limitations\n\n  Any type of Roblox object such as an Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, or\n  others can be passed as a parameter when a Class.RemoteFunction is invoked,\n  as well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you\n  should carefully explore the\n  limitations.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: RemoteFunction:InvokeClient\n    summary: |\n      Invokes the Class.RemoteFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.RemoteFunction.OnClientInvoke|OnClientInvoke callback.\n    description: |\n      Invokes the Class.RemoteFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.RemoteFunction.OnClientInvoke|OnClientInvoke callback. Since this\n      method is used to communicate from the server to a client, it will only\n      work when used in a Class.Script.\n\n      Any type of Roblox object such as an Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, or\n      others can be passed as a parameter to\n      Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeClient()|InvokeClient(), as well as Luau\n      types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should\n      carefully explore the\n      limitations.\n\n      See Remote Events and Callbacks for\n      code samples and further details on Class.RemoteFunction.\n\n      #### Warning\n\n      In practice, the server does not often invoke the client, as clients\n      typically do not have information that the server doesn't have, and\n      actions that only a client can take, such as displaying a GUI, typically\n      do not require a callback. As such, Class.RemoteEvent:FireClient() is\n      recommended as an asynchronous method that doesn't need to wait for a\n      response to continue execution.\n\n      If you legitimately need to invoke a client from the server, note the\n      following risks:\n\n      - If the client throws an error, the server throws the error too.\n      - If the client disconnects while it's being invoked,\n        Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeClient()|InvokeClient() throws an error.\n      - If the client doesn't return a value, the server yields forever.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: player\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player associated with the client to invoke.\n      - name: arguments\n        type: Tuple\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Values to pass to the\n          Class.RemoteFunction.OnClientInvoke|OnClientInvoke callback.\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: |\n          Values returned from the\n          Class.RemoteFunction.OnClientInvoke|OnClientInvoke callback.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - RemoteEvent\n  - name: RemoteFunction:InvokeServer\n    summary: |\n      Invokes the Class.RemoteFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke|OnServerInvoke callback.\n    description: |\n      Invokes the Class.RemoteFunction which in turn calls the\n      Class.RemoteFunction.OnServerInvoke|OnServerInvoke callback.
