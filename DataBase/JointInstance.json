Every assembly has a root part\n  (Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()) and when\n  Class.JointInstance.C0|C0/Class.JointInstance.C1|C1 of a\n  Class.JointInstance is modified, the root part will stay where it was.\n\n  Welds do not have any directionality. You can imagine rigid joints forming a\n  tree branching down from the root part. All the parts down the tree from root\n  will move, and their welded \"children\" in this tree will move with them.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - DynamicRotate\n  - Glue\n  - ManualSurfaceJointInstance\n  - Motor\n  - Rotate\n  - Snap\n  - VelocityMotor\n  - Weld\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: JointInstance.Active\n    summary: |\n      Determines if the joint is currently active in the world.\n    description: |\n      This property determines if the joint is currently active in the world.\n\n      If the Class.JointInstance is not in Class.Workspace or\n      Class.JointsService, or one of its parts is not in Class.Workspace,\n      the joint will be inactive.\n\n      Rigid joints like Class.Weld, Class.Snap, Class.WeldConstraint,\n      Class.Motor, or Class.Motor6D may also be disabled due to conflicts\n      with other rigid joints, such as joints between the same two parts or\n      indirect cycles in the weld graph. Joints disabled this way may be\n      re-enabled later when another joint or part is added or removed.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: JointInstance.C0\n    summary: |\n      Determines how the offset point is attached to\n      Class.JointInstance.Part0.\n    description: |\n      C0 is the position aspect of the orientation between two parts in a\n      weld.
