This method is enabled and disabled by the\n      Class.Players.BanningEnabled property, which you can toggle in Studio.\n    description: |\n      The Class.Players:BanAsync() method allows you to easily ban users who\n      violate your experience's guidelines. You can specify the ban duration,\n      enable the ban to propagate to suspected alternate accounts, and provide a\n      message to the banned user in accordance with the\n      Usage Guidelines. You should\n      also post your experience rules somewhere accessible to all users and\n      provide a way for them to appeal. This method is enabled and disabled by\n      the Class.Players.BanningEnabled property, which you can toggle in\n      Studio.\n\n      ##### Banning and Messaging\n\n      Banned users will be immediately evicted and prevented from rejoining your\n      experiences. They will be presented with an error modal displaying the\n      time left on their ban and your DisplayReason. Roblox's backend systems\n      will evict players across all servers from the place(s) that you specify.\n      DisplayReason can have a maximum length of 400 characters and is subject\n      to a text filter. For more information on acceptable modal text, see\n      ban messaging.\n\n      ##### Places and Universe\n\n      By default, bans extend to any place within that universe. To limit the\n      ban to only the place from which this API is called, configure\n      ApplyToUniverse to false. However, if a user is banned in the start\n      place of the universe, it effectively results in the user being excluded\n      from the entirety of the universe, irrespective of whether a universal ban\n      is in place or not.\n\n      ##### Alternative Accounts\n\n      Users often play under multiple different accounts, known as alternate\n      accounts or alt accounts, which are sometimes used to circumvent account\n      bans. To help you keep banned users out, the default behavior of this API\n      will propagate all bans from the source account you banned to any of their\n      suspected alt accounts. You can turn off ban propagations to alt accounts\n      by configuring ExcludeAltAccounts to true.\n\n      ##### Ban Duration\n\n      Not all transgressions are the same, so not all bans should be the same\n      length. This API lets you configure the duration of the ban, in seconds,\n      with the Duration field. To specify a permanent ban, set the field to\n      -1. You may also want to dynamically configure the ban duration based on\n      the user's ban history, which you can query for using\n      Class.Players:GetBanHistoryAsync(). For example, you may want to\n      consider the number of bans, the duration of previous bans, or build logic\n      off of the notes you save under PrivateReason which can be up to 1000\n      characters and are not text filtered. PrivateReason notes are never\n      shared with the client and can be considered safe from attackers.\n\n      ##### Errors and Throttling\n\n      This method invokes an HTTP call to backend services which are subject to\n      throttling and may fail. If you're calling this API with more than one\n      Class.Player.UserId|UserId, this method will attempt to make the HTTP\n      call for each ID. It will then aggregate any error messages and join them\n      as a comma separated list. For example, if this method is invoked for five\n      users and requests for those with Class.Player.UserId|UserIds 2 and 4\n      fail, the following error message appears:\n\n      HTTP failure for UserId 2: Timedout, HTTP 504 (Service unavailable) failure for UserId 4: Service exception\n\n      The message will always include failure for UserId {} if it is an HTTP\n      error.\n\n      ##### Client-Side Requirement\n\n      Because of the risks associated with banning users, this method may only\n      be called on the backend experience server (client-side calls will result\n      in an error). You may test this API in Studio, during\n      collaborative creation, or in a\n      team test, but\n      the bans will not apply to production.\n\n      This API uses the\n      User Restrictions Open Cloud API. You\n      will be able to utilize these APIs to manage your bans in third party\n      applications.\n    codesamples:\n      - Players-Ban\n    parameters:\n      - name: config\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          - UserIds (required; array) — Array of Class.Player.UserId|UserIds\n            of players to be banned.

This\n      method is enabled and disabled by the Class.Players.BanningEnabled\n      property, which you can toggle in Studio.\n\n      Like Class.Players:BanAsync(), this method takes in a config\n      dictionary that will let you bulk unban users. This configures the users\n      that are unbanned and the scope from which they are unbanned from.\n\n      Unbans will only take effect on bans with the same ApplyToUniverse\n      scope. For example, an unban with ApplyToUniverse set to true will not\n      invalidate a previous ban with ApplyToUniverse set to false. In other\n      words, a universe level unban will not invalidate a place level ban. The\n      opposite also holds true.\n\n      This method invokes a HTTP call to backend services, which are throttled\n      and may fail. If you are calling this API with multiple UserIds, this\n      method will attempt to make this HTTP call for each UserId. It will then\n      aggregate any error messages and join them as a comma separated list. For\n      example, if this method is invoked for five UserIds: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n      and requests for users 2 and 4 fail then the following error message\n      appears:\n      HTTP failure for UserId 2: Timedout, HTTP 504 (Service unavailable) failure for UserId 4: Service exception.\n      The message will always include failure for UserId {} if it is an HTTP\n      error. It is undefined behavior if you pass in both valid and invalid\n      UserIds, i.e. a UserId that is not a positive number, as some network\n      requests may succeed before all input is validated.\n\n      Because of the risks associated with banning users, this method may only\n      be called on the backend server. Client side calls will result in an\n      error. You may test this API in Studio, Team Create, and Team Test, but\n      the bans will not apply to production. This function call will only\n      attempt ban requests on production servers and not in Studio testing.\n      However, all input validation steps will still work in Studio.\n\n      This API uses the\n      User Restrictions Open Cloud API. You\n      will be able to utilize these APIs to manage your bans in third party\n      applications.\n    codesamples:\n      - Players-Unban\n    parameters:\n      - name: config\n        type: Dictionary\n        default:\n        summary: |\n\n\n            Name\n            Type\n            Description\n\n\n\n              UserIds\n              array\n              UserIDs to be force allowed into the experience(s).

To handle this case, as well as\n      cases in which the script is added into the experience after a player\n      enters, create an onPlayerAdded() function that you can call to handle a\n      player's entrance.\n    codesamples:\n      - Players-PlayerAdded1\n    parameters:\n      - name: player\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          An instance of the player that joined the experience.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Players\n  - name: Players.PlayerMembershipChanged\n    summary: |\n      Fires when the experience server recognizes that a player's membership has\n      changed.\n    description: |\n      This event fires when the experience server recognizes that a player's\n      membership has changed.
