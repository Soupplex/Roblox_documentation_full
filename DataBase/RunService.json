Methods like\n  Class.RunService:IsClient()|IsClient(),\n  Class.RunService:IsServer()|IsServer(), and\n  Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio() can help you determine under what\n  context code is running. These methods are useful for\n  Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts that may be required by both client and\n  server scripts. Furthermore, Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio() can be\n  used to add special behaviors for in‑Studio testing.\n\n  RunService also houses events that allow your code to adhere to the engine's\n  frame‑by‑frame loop, such as Class.RunService.PreRender|PreRender,\n  Class.RunService.PreAnimation|PreAnimation,\n  Class.RunService.PreSimulation|PreSimulation,\n  Class.RunService.PostSimulation|PostSimulation, and\n  Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat. Selecting the proper event to use for\n  any case is important, so you should read\n  Task Scheduler\n  to make an informed decision.\n\n  ##### Context Test Results\n\n\n\n\n        Environment\n        Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio\n        Class.RunService:IsClient()|IsClient\n        Class.RunService:IsServer()|IsServer\n        Class.RunService:IsEdit()|IsEdit\n        Class.RunService:IsRunning()|IsRunning\n        Class.RunService:IsRunMode()|IsRunMode\n\n\n\n\n        Live (Client)\n        false\n        true\n        false\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Live (Server)\n        false\n        false\n        true\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Edit\n        true\n        true\n        true\n        true\n        false\n        false\n\n\n        Collaborative Edit\n        true\n        true\n        false\n        true\n        false\n        false\n\n\n        Run Mode\n        true\n        false\n        true\n\n        true\n        true\n\n\n        Play Mode (Client)\n        true\n        true\n        false\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Play Mode (Server)\n        true\n        false\n        true\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Team Test (Client)\n        true\n        true\n        false\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Team Test (Server)\n        true\n        false\n        true\n\n        true\n        false\n\n\n        Luau Execution\n        false\n        false\n        true\n\n        false\n        false\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: RunService.ClientGitHash\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxScriptSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: RunService.RunState\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: RunState\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods:\n  - name: RunService:BindToRenderStep\n    summary: |\n      Given a string name of a function and a priority, this method binds the\n      function to Class.RunService.PreRender.\n    description: |\n      The BindToRenderStep() function binds a custom function to be called at\n      a specific time during the render step. There are three main arguments:\n      name, priority, and what function to call.\n\n      As it is linked to the client's rendering process, BindToRenderStep()\n      can only be called on the client.\n\n      ##### Name\n\n      The name parameter is a label for the binding and can be used with\n      Class.RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep() if the binding is no longer\n      needed.\n\n      lua\n      local RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\n      local function functionToBind() end\n\n      -- Bind the function above to the binding named \"tempBinding\"\n      RunService:BindToRenderStep(\"tempBinding\", 1, functionToBind)\n      -- Unbind the function bound to \"tempBinding\"\n      RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep(\"tempBinding\")\n\n\n      ##### Priority\n\n      The priority of the binding is an integer; it determines when during the\n      render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the sooner\n      the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same\n      priority, the engine will randomly pick one to run first. The default\n      control scripts run with these specific priorities:\n\n      - Player Input: 100\n      - Camera Controls: 200 For convenience; the Enum.RenderPriority enum\n        can be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For\n        example, to make a binding right before the default camera update,\n        simply subtract 1 from the camera priority level.\n\n      When using Enum.RenderPriority, remember to use .Value at the end of\n      the desired enum. Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep() will not work if\n      just the enum is used on its own.\n\n      lua\n      local RunService = game:GetService(\"RunService\")\n\n      local function beforeCamera(delta)\n      \t-- Code in here will run before the default camera script\n      end\n\n      RunService:BindToRenderStep(\"Before camera\", Enum.RenderPriority.Camera.Value - 1, beforeCamera)\n\n\n      ##### Custom Function and Delta Time\n\n      The last argument (function) is the custom function to call. This\n      function will be passed one parameter called deltaTime which shows how\n      much time passed between the beginning of the previous render step and the\n      beginning of the current render step.\n\n      All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step\n      finishes. Make sure that any code called by BindToRenderStep() runs\n      quickly and efficiently; if code takes too long, the experience visuals\n      will be choppy.\n    codesamples:\n      - RunService-BindToRenderStep\n      - runservice-custom-function\n      - runservice-unbindfromrenderstep\n    parameters:\n      - name: name\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Label for the binding which can be used with\n          Class.RunService.Unbind|Unbind if the binding is no longer needed.\n      - name: priority\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Priority of the binding as an integer; it determines when during the\n          render step to call the custom function.

This method is only available when\n      Class.Workspace.UseFixedSimulation is enabled.\n\n      Note that since the bound function is meant for physics controllers and\n      prediction, an error will trigger if you read or write from unsynchronized\n      properties or call an unsynchronized method. This error is meant to help\n      guide you in writing a pure, synchronized simulation.\n\n      To synchronize inaccessible properties, you should store the relevant data\n      in attributes and\n      update the relevant property in\n      Class.RunService.PostSimulation|PostSimulation or\n      Class.RunService.RenderStepped|RenderStepped by reading from attributes.\n      This will leverage attribute synchronization to keep the property fully\n      synchronized through the rollback mechanism.\n    codesamples:\n      - RunService-BindToSimulation\n    parameters:\n      - name: function\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The function to call.

The deltaTimeSim argument indicates the\n      time that the current frame has stepped animations.\n\n      This event is useful for modifying animation objects, such as adjusting\n      their speed or priority. Once the PreAnimation event is complete, the\n      engine proceeds to run these animations, updating the joint transforms\n      which will later be used to update objects during the physics simulation.\n\n      After animations are stepped, the engine triggers the\n      Class.RunService.PreSimulation|PreSimulation event.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: deltaTimeSim\n        type: double\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The time (in seconds) that the current frame has stepped animations.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: RunService.PreRender\n    summary: |\n      Fires every frame, prior to the frame being rendered.\n    description: |\n      The PreRender event (replacement for\n      Class.RunService.RenderStepped|RenderStepped) fires every frame, prior\n      to the frame being rendered. The deltaTimeRender argument indicates the\n      time that has elapsed since the previous frame.\n\n      This event allows you to run code and update the world before it's drawn\n      on a player's screen. This is useful for last‑minute adjustments such as\n      changing object positions, updating animations, or preparing visual\n      effects, but it should be used sparingly as the engine cannot start to\n      render the frame until code running in this event has finished executing.\n\n      As PreRender is client-side, it can only be used in a\n      Class.LocalScript, in a Class.ModuleScript required by a\n      Class.LocalScript, or in a Class.Script with\n      Class.BaseScript.RunContext|RunContext set to Enum.RunContext.Client.\n\n      Following the PreRender phase, the simulation phase begins with the\n      Class.RunService.PreAnimation|PreAnimation event.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: deltaTimeRender\n        type: double\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The time (in seconds) that has elapsed since the previous frame.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: RunService.PreSimulation\n    summary: |\n      Fires every frame, prior to the physics simulation.\n    description: |\n      The PreSimulation event (replacement for\n      Class.RunService.Stepped|Stepped) fires every frame, prior to the\n      physics simulation.

The simulation then\n      runs, potentially multiple times, as the physics solver runs at a higher\n      frequency than other engine systems.
