It acts like a hybrid of\n  Class.BodyPosition and Class.BodyGyro. Unlike other\n  Class.BodyMover|BodyMovers, RocketPropulsion must be instructed to begin\n  applying or stopping force via Class.RocketPropulsion:Fire()|Fire() or\n  Class.RocketPropulsion:Abort()|Abort() respectively.\n\n  You can detect when the assembly reaches its target using the\n  Class.RocketPropulsion.ReachedTarget|ReachedTarget event which fires once\n  the assembly is within the Class.RocketPropulsion.TargetRadius|TargetRadius\n  of the Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target part.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BodyMover\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: |\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
