In other words,\n  this contains a boolean for each axes (X/Y/Z) in both directions\n  (positive/negative). The Class.Handles object uses this data type to enable\n  whether a direction has a visible handle on a Part's face.\n\n  lua\n  local handles = Instance.new(\"Handles\")\n  handles.Faces = Faces.new(Enum.NormalId.Front, Enum.NormalId.Left)\n\n\n  Like most data types on Roblox, the Faces data type is immutable: you cannot\n  assign to its properties once created.\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  - name: Faces.new\n    summary: Returns a Faces with the corresponding face of each passed Enum.NormalId as true.\n    description: |-\n      Creates a new Faces given some number of Enum.NormalId as arguments.
