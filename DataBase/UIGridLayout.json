It then continues adding elements in the next row.\n  A UIGridLayout will take UI elements' Class.GuiObject.Size and\n  Class.GuiObject.Position under control. While under control, these UI\n  elements' properties will not be editable in the Properties window.\n\n  By default, it lays out elements in ascending order where lower values\n  take more priority over higher values, but this can be changed to use\n  elements' names by changing Class.UIListLayout.SortOrder to Name. A\n  UIListLayout will automatically re-layout elements when elements are\n  added/removed, or if a relevant property changes:\n  Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder or Class.Instance.Name. This can be triggered\n  manually by calling Class.UIGridStyleLayout:ApplyLayout(), though this is\n  typically not necessary.\n\n  The actual cell sizes are the same for all cells. A UIGridLayout will respect\n  UI constraints placed with it, such as Class.UISizeConstraint and\n  Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint. Elements in the layout can span multiple\n  cells if they have a Class.UISizeConstraint with a\n  Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize set higher than the\n  Class.UIGridLayout.CellSize|CellSize. It is possible to limit the number of\n  elements per row using Class.UIGridLayout.FillDirectionMaxCells. If set to\n  1, it is possible to create a single row of elements (as each element would be\n  positioned in its own row).\n\n  This layout is appropriate when line breaks are OK after arbitrary cells. For\n  example, a set of inventory spaces is a good use of this layout. If building a\n  table of values in which a line break is not appropriate in the middle of\n  tabular data, it might be a better idea to use a Class.UITableLayout\n  instead.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIGridStyleLayout\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UIGridLayout.AbsoluteCellCount\n    summary: |\n      The number of elements in the grid.\n    description: |\n      Measures the maximum number of elements in each direction.
