The appearance of the gradient is\n  configurable through its Class.UIGradient.Color|Color\n  (Datatype.ColorSequence), Class.UIGradient.Transparency|Transparency\n  (Datatype.NumberSequence), Class.UIGradient.Offset|Offset\n  (Datatype.Vector2), and Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation (number).\n\n  A Class.UIGradient will not apply to child or descendant\n  Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects. In order to apply the same gradient to multiple\n  objects, you will need multiple gradient instances.\n\n  See also Appearance Modifiers for more\n  information on Class.UIGradient objects and how they work.\n\n  #### Supported Objects\n\n  You can apply gradients to Class.Frame, Class.TextLabel,\n  Class.TextButton, Class.ImageLabel, Class.ImageButton, and\n  Class.ViewportFrame. However, Class.ScrollingFrame and Class.TextBox are\n  not currently supported.\n\n  #### Performance Considerations\n\n  In order to efficiently use a Class.UIGradient, follow these principles:\n\n  - Avoid using more than 6 color stops on the Class.UIGradient.Color|Color\n    sequence.\n\n  - Avoid using a Class.UIGradient on any object that applies a text stroke\n    (Class.TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3|TextStrokeColor3), as the gradient will\n    try to blend with strokes and borders, and may cause performance issues.\n\n  - Avoid setting Class.UIGradient.Color|Color and\n    Class.UIGradient.Transparency|Transparency frequently: this causes the\n    sequence of colors to rebuild often, which is expensive. If possible, set\n    these properties only once and try to animate the\n    Class.UIGradient.Offset|Offset or Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation\n    properties to achieve a similar effect. Alternatively, you can change the\n    color of the parent Class.GuiObject using such properties as\n    Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3,\n    Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3|ImageColor3, or\n    Class.TextLabel.TextColor3|TextColor3.\n\n  - When applying an unchanging gradient on a UI element whose state changes a\n    lot, there is a tradeoff between using a Class.UIGradient (processing\n    time) and a static gradient image (memory).\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIComponent\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UIGradient.Color\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color blended with the parent GuiObject along the length of\n      the gradient.\n    description: |\n      This property describes the color to blend with the parent UI element\n      along the provided Datatype.ColorSequence.

It is a scalar translation,\n      meaning that the actual pixel offset is determined by the\n      Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize of the parent\n      Class.GuiObject. So, a value of (1, 0) would shift the gradient\n      horizontally to the right by a distance equal to the parent object's\n      on‑screen size. Depending on the Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation,\n      this may cause the gradient to be partially visible or not visible at all.\n\n      Also see Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation which also affects the\n      geometry of the applied gradient.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector2\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGradient.Rotation\n    summary: |\n      Determines the clockwise rotation in degrees of the gradient starting from\n      left to right.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the clockwise rotation in degrees of the\n      Class.UIGradient starting from left to right.
