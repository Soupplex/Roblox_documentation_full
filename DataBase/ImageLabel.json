The display of the image can be manipulated through the\n  Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3|ImageColor3 and\n  Class.ImageLabel.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency properties. To display\n  only the image and hide the rectangle, set\n  Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency to 1.\n\n  Advanced Class.ImageLabel usage includes:\n\n  - Tiled images can be created by setting\n    Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType|ScaleType to Enum.ScaleType.Tile, then\n    Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize to the size of rendered tiles.\n\n  - 9-slice images can be created by setting\n    Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType|ScaleType to Enum.ScaleType.Slice, then\n    Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter|SliceCenter to the center area of the 9‑slice\n    image.\n\n  - Sprite sheets can be implemented through the use of\n    Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectOffset|ImageRectOffset and\n    Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectSize|ImageRectSize. Packing multiple images into\n    one and using this property can make your experience's image assets load\n    much quicker, especially if you use many small icons in your GUIs.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiLabel\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ImageLabel.Image\n    summary: |\n      The image content displayed by the UI element.

Since transparent pixels are set to black when uploading to\n      Roblox, transparent images should apply alpha blending to avoid a blackish\n      outline around scaled images.\n\n      For Enum.ScaleType.Slice, the Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter|SliceCenter\n      property will be revealed in the\n      Properties window. This is for nine-slice\n      UI: when scaling up, the corners will remain the source image size. The\n      edges of the image will stretch to the width/height of the image. Finally,\n      the center of the image will stretch to fill the center area of the image.\n\n      Finally, for Enum.ScaleType.Tile, the\n      Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize property will be revealed in the\n      Properties window. This is for tiled\n      images, where the size of each image tile is determined by the\n      Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize property.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ScaleType\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Image\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: ImageLabel.SliceCenter\n    summary: |\n      Sets the slice boundaries of a 9-sliced image.\n    description: |\n      This property sets the slice boundaries of a 9-sliced image when\n      Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType|ScaleType is set to\n      Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice.
