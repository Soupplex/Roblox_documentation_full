The halo is\n  shaped/blocked by world objects between the Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera\n  and the sun.\n\n  Like other post-processing effects, SunRaysEffect will only work while\n  Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled and when parented to Class.Lighting or\n  Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera. Also, it may not render on low-end devices,\n  and it may render differently depending on your Studio settings (see the\n  Quality Level settings in Rendering &rarr; Performance).\n\n  For more details on this effect and others, see\n  Post-Processing Effects.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - PostEffect\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SunRaysEffect.Intensity\n    summary: |\n      Determines the opacity of the sun rays.\n    description: |\n      Intensity determines the opacity of the sun rays.
