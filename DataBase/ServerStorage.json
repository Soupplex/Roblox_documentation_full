Objects\n  descending from ServerStorage will not replicate to the client and will not be\n  accessible from Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts.\n\n  As ServerStorage is a service it can only be accessed using the\n  Class.DataModel.GetService method.\n\n  By storing large objects such as maps in ServerStorage until they are needed,\n  network traffic will not be used up transmitting these objects to the client\n  when they join the game.\n\n  Class.Script|Scripts will not run when they are parented to ServerStorage,\n  although Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts contained within can be accessed\n  and ran. It is recommended developers use Class.ServerScriptService to hold\n  Class.Script|Scripts they wish the server to execute.\n\n  Note that as the contents of ServerStorage can only be accessed by the server,\n  its contents will need to be parented elsewhere (such as Class.Workspace)\n  before clients can access them. Developers who require a container that is\n  accessible by both the server and client are advised to use\n  Class.ReplicatedStorage instead.\ncodesamples:\n  - ServerStorage-Maps\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
