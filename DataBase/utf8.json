This library does\n  not provide any support for Unicode other than the handling of the encoding.\n  Any operation that needs the meaning of a character, such as character\n  classification, is outside its scope.\n\n  Unless stated otherwise, all functions that expect a byte position as a\n  parameter assume that the given position is either the start of a byte\n  sequence or one plus the length of the subject string. As in the string\n  library, negative indices count from the end of the string.\n\n  You can find a large catalog of usable UTF-8 characters\n  here.\ntags: []\ncodesamples: []\nproperties:\n  - name: utf8.charpattern\n    type: string\n    summary: |\n      The pattern \"[%z\\x01-\\x7F\\xC2-\\xF4][\\x80-\\xBF]\", which matches exactly\n      zero or more UTF-8 byte sequences, assuming that the subject is a valid\n      UTF-8 string.\n    description: |\n      The pattern \"[%z\\x01-\\x7F\\xC2-\\xF4][\\x80-\\xBF]\", which matches exactly\n      zero or more UTF-8 byte sequence, assuming that the subject is a valid\n      UTF-8 string.\n    tags: []\n    codesamples: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\nfunctions:\n  - name: utf8.char\n    summary: |\n      Converts zero or more codepoints to UTF-8 byte sequences.\n    description: |\n      Receives zero or more codepoints as integers, converts each one to its\n      corresponding UTF-8 byte sequence and returns a string with the\n      concatenation of all these sequences.\n    parameters:\n      - name: codepoints\n        type: Tuple\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: string\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    codesamples: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: utf8.codes\n    summary: |\n      Returns an iterator function that iterates over all codepoints in a given\n      string.\n    description: |\n      Returns an iterator function so that the construction:\n\n      lua\n      for position, codepoint in utf8.codes(str) do\n      \t-- body\n      end\n\n\n      will iterate over all codepoints in string str.
