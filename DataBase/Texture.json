The affected face is dependent on the\n  Class.Texture.Face|Face property. Unlike Class.Decal|Decals, the texture\n  applied by a Class.Texture will repeat when the parent Class.BasePart is\n  resized, with the size of the repeating textures determined by the\n  Class.Texture.StudsPerTileU|StudsPerTileU and\n  Class.Texture.StudsPerTileV|StudsPerTileV properties.\n\n  The applied image texture is determined by its\n  Class.Texture.ColorMapContent|ColorMapContent property. For details on how\n  to upload images, see\n  asset management.\n\n  For more information, review\n  textures and decals.
