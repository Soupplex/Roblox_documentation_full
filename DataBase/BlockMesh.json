It behaves identically to a Class.SpecialMesh with\n  Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType set to 'brick'.\n\n  ## What does a BlockMesh do?\n\n  A BlockMesh gives the Class.BasePart it was applied to a brick shaped mesh.\n  It is identical in appearance to a standard Roblox Class.Part.\n\n  The dimensions of the mesh will scale linearly in all directions with\n  Class.BasePart.Size, this means a part containing a BlockMesh can be resized\n  the same way as any other part.\n\n  The additional functionality a BlockMesh brings however, is the ability to set\n  the Class.DataModelMesh.Scale and Class.DataModelMesh.Offset properties.\n  These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be\n  changed without changing the Class.BasePart.Position or\n  Class.BasePart.Size of the Class.BasePart the mesh is parented to.\n\n  Note as the Class.BlockMesh object does not include a texture the\n  Class.DataModelMesh.VertexColor property does not do anything.\ncodesamples:\n  - BlockMesh-Instantiation\ninherits:\n  - BevelMesh\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
