It\n  also features methods for common vector operations, such as\n  Datatype.Vector3:Cross()|Cross() and Datatype.Vector3:Dot()|Dot().\n\n  Alternatively to Datatype.Vector3, consider using the methods and properties\n  of the Library.vector library.\n\n  Some example usages of Datatype.Vector3 are the\n  Class.BasePart.Position|Position, Class.BasePart.Rotation|Rotation, and\n  Class.BasePart.Size|Size of parts, for example:\n\n  lua\n  local Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\n  local part = Workspace.Part\n  part.Position = part.Position + Vector3.new(5, 2, 10) -- Move part by (5, 2, 10)\n\n\n  Datatype.Vector3 is also commonly used when constructing more complex 3D\n  data types such as Datatype.CFrame. Many of these data types' methods will\n  use a Datatype.Vector3 within their parameters, such as\n  Datatype.CFrame:PointToObjectSpace().\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  -
