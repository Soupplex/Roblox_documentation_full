A\n  Class.ProximityPrompt object works when parented to a Class.BasePart,\n  Class.Attachment, or Class.Model (with\n  Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart set) in the workspace. When the player's\n  character approaches, a UI appears to prompt them for input.\n\n  Prompts consist of three primary elements, each of which can be controlled by\n  the noted properties. The default UI can be swapped out for your own custom\n  appearance as outlined in Class.ProximityPrompt.Style|Style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Property\n      Description\n      Default\n\n\n\n\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.ObjectText|ObjectText\n      An optional name for the object being interacted with.\n\n\n\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.ActionText|ActionText\n      An optional action name shown to the player.\n      Interact\n\n\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.KeyboardKeyCode|KeyboardKeyCode\n      The keyboard key which will trigger the prompt.\n      E\n\n\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.GamepadKeyCode|GamepadKeyCode\n      The gamepad button which will trigger the prompt.\n      ButtonX\n\n\n\n\n  You can connect to proximity prompt events either on the\n  Class.ProximityPrompt object itself or globally through\n  Class.ProximityPromptService. The Class.ProximityPromptService allows you\n  to manage all proximity prompt behavior from one location, preventing any need\n  for duplicate code in your experience.\n\n  For more information regarding proximity prompts, see the\n  Proximity Prompts guide.\ncodesamples:\n  - using-a-proximity-prompt-with-a-seat\n  - generating-a-custom-proximity-prompt\n  - healing-proximity-prompt\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ProximityPrompt.ActionText\n    summary: |\n      The action text shown to the user.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the action text shown to the user.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n      - Input\n  - name: ProximityPrompt.AutoLocalize\n    summary: |\n      Whether the prompt's Class.ProximityPrompt.ActionText and\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.ObjectText will be localized according to the\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.RootLocalizationTable.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the prompt's\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.ActionText and Class.ProximityPrompt.ObjectText\n      will be localized according to the\n      Class.ProximityPrompt.RootLocalizationTable.
