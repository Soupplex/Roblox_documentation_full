Secondly, there is no replication available from client\n          to the server.\n\n      - The original parts remain intact following a successful operation. In\n        most cases, you should parent the returned\n        Class.PartOperation|PartOperations to the same place as the main part,\n        then Class.Instance.Destroy|Destroy() all of the original parts.\n\n      - By default, the colors of the resulting\n        Class.PartOperation|PartOperations are borrowed from the\n        Class.BasePart.Color|Color property of the original parts, although\n        you can enable their Class.PartOperation.UsePartColor|UsePartColor\n        property to change them to a specific color.\n\n      - If a union operation would result in any\n        Class.PartOperation|PartOperations with more than 20,000 triangles,\n        they will be simplified to 20,000. This will result in an error with\n        code -14.\n\n      - If the main part is moving during the calculation of the operation, you\n        can set the resulting parts to the updated Datatype.CFrame of the main\n        part, since the returned parts are in the same coordinate space as the\n        main part.\n\n      - If using this method with a Class.PartOperation as the main part, you\n        can substitute the geometry of another Class.PartOperation via\n        Class.PartOperation:SubstituteGeometry()|SubstituteGeometry(), making\n        it easier to utilize the geometry of the operation but maintain\n        properties, attributes, tags, and children of the main part such as\n        Class.Attachment|Attachments, Class.Constraint|Constraints,\n        Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters, light objects, and decals.\n        This approach also circumvents the potential \"flicker\" of completely\n        replacing the original Class.PartOperation with another.\n    codesamples:\n      - GeometryService-UnionAsync\n    parameters:\n      - name: part\n        type: Instance\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Main Class.Part or Class.PartOperation to operate on.\n      - name: parts\n        type: Array\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Array of parts to union with the main part.\n      - name: options\n        type: Dictionary\n        default: nil\n        summary: |\n          Options table containing all the controls for the method:\n\n          - CollisionFidelity — The value of\n            Class.PartOperation.CollisionFidelity|CollisionFidelity in the\n            resulting parts.\n          - RenderFidelity — The value of\n            Class.PartOperation.RenderFidelity|RenderFidelity in the resulting\n            parts.\n          - FluidFidelity — The value of\n            Class.PartOperation.FluidFidelity|FluidFidelity in the resulting\n            parts.\n          - SplitApart — Boolean controlling whether the objects should all be\n            kept together or properly split apart.
