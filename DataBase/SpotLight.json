This object is ideal for directional light sources like flashlights\n  and headlights.\n\n  Class.SpotLight.Range|Range controls the distance of illumination and\n  Class.SpotLight.Angle|Angle defines the angle of light emission from the\n  cone's apex as illustrated below.\n\n  A spotlight must be a direct child of a Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment\n  and will exhibit the following behavior:\n\n  - When the spotlight is parented to a Class.BasePart, the\n    Class.SpotLight.Face|Face property determines the face of the part from\n    which light emanates.\n\n  - Although Class.Attachment|Attachments don't have faces, the\n    Class.SpotLight.Face|Face property determines the axis of the attachment\n    from which light emanates; -Z is front, +X is right, +Y is top,\n    etc.\n\n  See also Class.SurfaceLight and Class.PointLight.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Light\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SpotLight.Angle\n    summary: |\n      The angle of which the light is shone from the SpotLight.\n    description: |\n      The angle of which the light is shone from the SpotLight.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SpotLight.Face\n    summary: |\n      Sets the side of the parent that the SpotLight comes from.\n    description: |\n      Sets the side of the parent that the SpotLight comes from.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: NormalId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SpotLight.Range\n    summary: |\n      The size of the area that the SpotLight will illuminate.\n    description: |\n      The size of the area that the SpotLight will illuminate.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
