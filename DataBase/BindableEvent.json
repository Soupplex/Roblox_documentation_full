When you fire a\n  Class.BindableEvent through the Class.BindableEvent:Fire() method, the\n  firing script does not yield and the target function receives the passed\n  arguments with certain limitations.\n  Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents create threads of each connected\n  function, so even if one firing errors, others continue.\n\n  As an alternative for two-way communication between two scripts on the same\n  side of the client-server boundary, consider Class.BindableFunction.\n\n  As stated, Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents do not allow for communication\n  between the server and clients. If you are looking for this functionality, use\n  a Class.RemoteEvent as outlined in\n  Remote Events and Callbacks.\n\n  See Bindable events and callbacks for\n  code samples and further details on Class.BindableEvent.\n\n  #### Parameter Limitations\n\n  Any type of Roblox object such as an Datatype.Enum, Class.Instance, or\n  others can be passed as a parameter when a Class.BindableEvent is fired, as\n  well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should\n  carefully explore the\n  limitations.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: BindableEvent:Fire\n    summary: |\n      Fires the Class.BindableEvent which in turn fires the\n      Class.BindableEvent.Event|Event event.\n    description: |\n      Fires the Class.BindableEvent which in turn fires the\n      Class.BindableEvent.Event|Event event.
