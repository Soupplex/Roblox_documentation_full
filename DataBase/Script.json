Additionally, the thread will be\n  stopped if the script or one of its ancestors is destroyed. A script will\n  continue to run even if the Class.Instance.Parent|Parent property is set to\n  nil and the Class.Script is not destroyed.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BaseScript\ndescendants:\n  - LocalScript\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Script.Source\n    summary: |\n      The code to be executed.\n    description: |\n      Represents the code to be executed.
