The Class.Motor6D.Transform|Transform\n  property determines the offset between these parts. This can be set manually\n  using Class.RunService.PreSimulation or through an Class.Animator.\n\n  Models whose parts are joined by Class.Motor6D are usually referred to as\n  rigs, typically for Class.Humanoid|Humanoids.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Motor\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Motor6D.ChildName\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n      - NotScriptable\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Animatable\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: Motor6D.ParentName\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n      - NotScriptable\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Animatable\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: Motor6D.Transform\n    summary: |\n      Describes the current animation offset of the Class.Motor6D joint.\n    description: |\n      The internal Datatype.CFrame that is manipulated when a Class.Motor6D\n      is being animated. It is recommended to use this property for custom\n      animations rather than Class.JointInstance.C0 and\n      Class.JointInstance.C1.\n\n      ##### Timing\n\n      Class.Motor6D transforms are not applied immediately, unlike updating\n      Class.JointInstance.C0|C0 and Class.JointInstance.C1|C1, but rather as\n      a batch in a parallel job after Class.RunService.PreSimulation,\n      immediately before physics steps. The deferred batch update is much more\n      efficient than many immediate updates.\n\n      If the Class.Motor6D is part of an animated model with an\n      Class.Animator, then Class.Motor6D.Transform will usually be\n      overwritten every frame by the Class.Animator after\n      Class.RunService.PreAnimation and before\n      Class.RunService.PreSimulation.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: CFrame\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
