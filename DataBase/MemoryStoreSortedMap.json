A sorted\n  map is a collection of items where string keys are associated with arbitrary\n  values (up to the maximum allowed size -- see\n  Memory Stores). Each\n  item can also have an optional sort key, which can be a number or a string. In\n  the ordering of items, the sort key, if provided, takes precedence over the\n  key. Items with numeric sort keys are sorted before items with string sort\n  keys, which are sorted before items with no sort key. Items with the same sort\n  key and items with no sort key are arranged in alphabetical order by key.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: MemoryStoreSortedMap:GetAsync\n    summary: |\n      Retrieves the value and sort key of a key in the sorted map.\n    description: |\n      Retrieves the value and sort key of a key in the sorted map.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: key\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Key whose value and sort key to retrieve.\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: |\n          A tuple of two values:\n\n          - Key value, or nil if there's no item with the specified key.\n          - Sort key, or nil if there's no sort key associated with the\n            specified key.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - DataStore\n  - name: MemoryStoreSortedMap:GetRangeAsync\n    summary: |\n      Retrieves items within a sorted range of keys and sort keys.\n    description: |\n      Gets items within a sorted range of keys and sort keys.\n    codesamples:\n      - retrieving-memorystore-keys\n    parameters:\n      - name: direction\n        type: SortDirection\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Sort direction, ascending or descending.\n      - name: count\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The number of items to retrieve; the maximum allowed value for this\n          parameter is 200.\n      - name: exclusiveLowerBound\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          (Optional) Lower bound, exclusive, for the returned keys.
