If parented to a player's Class.PlayerGui or the\n  Class.CoreGui, handles can listen to input events for purposes such as\n  making dragger tools.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - HandleAdornment\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: CylinderHandleAdornment.Angle\n    summary: |\n      Angle of the cylinder handle as in a \"pie slice\" sector.\n    description: |\n      The angle of the cylinder handle as in a \"pie slice\" sector. For example,\n      if set to 90, a quarter cylinder will render instead of a full cylinder.\n      This property can be combined with\n      Class.CylinderHandleAdornment.InnerRadius|InnerRadius to render a sector\n      of a hollow cylinder.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: CylinderHandleAdornment.Height\n    summary: |\n      Height of the cylinder adornment.\n    description: |\n      The height of the cylinder adornment in studs.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n      - UI\n  - name: CylinderHandleAdornment.InnerRadius\n    summary: |\n      Inner radius with which to render a hollow cylinder.\n    description: |\n      The inner radius with which to render a hollow cylinder, in studs.
