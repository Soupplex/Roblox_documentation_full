For an example of this, see the code sample below.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples:\n      - handling-a-teleport-loading-gui\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Instance\n        summary: |\n          The customLoadingScreen the Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer\n          arrived into the place with.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData\n    summary: |\n      Returns the teleportData the Class.Players.LocalPlayer arrived into\n      the place with.\n    description: |\n      This function returns the teleport data the Class.Players.LocalPlayer\n      arrived with.

It is recommended that you wrap calls to this function in\n      pcall.\n\n      #### Limitations\n\n      You should be aware of the following limitations when using this function:\n\n      - This function can only be called by the server.\n      - This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is\n        teleporting.\n      - It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers\n        should wrap it in a Global.LuaGlobals.pcall() (see example below)\n      - As this function returns the JobId of the server and not the access code\n        returned by Class.TeleportService:ReserveServerAsync(), the ID\n        returned is not appropriate for use with reserved servers.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples:\n      - following-a-player-in-a-universe\n    parameters:\n      - name: userId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player.UserId of the Class.Player.\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: |\n          See the table above.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting\n    summary: |\n      Retrieves a teleport setting saved using\n      Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting() using the given key.\n    description: |\n      This function retrieves a teleport setting saved using\n      Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting() using the given key.\n\n      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used\n      on the server.\n\n      Teleport settings are preserved across teleportations within the same\n      game. This means data can be saved using\n      Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting() in one place and retrieved\n      using GetTeleportSetting in another place the user has been teleported to.\n\n      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the\n      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting.\n      This could then be retrieved in the destination place after the\n      teleportation:\n\n      lua\n      local TeleportService = game:GetService(\"TeleportService\")\n\n      local isCrouching = TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting(\"isCrouching\")\n\n\n      If no teleport setting exists under the given key, this function will\n      return nil.\n\n      #### Differences from GlobalDataStores\n\n      Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences\n      between teleport settings and datastores:\n\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync() stores the data on Roblox servers\n        whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally\n      - Data stored in a Class.GlobalDataStore is preserved after the user\n        leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores can only be accessed on the\n        server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores have usage limits, whereas\n        teleport settings do not\n\n      In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side\n      information within a single play session across different places in a\n      game. Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores should be used to save\n      important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.\n\n      #### Teleport settings and security\n\n      As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be\n      manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing\n      server side validation.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: setting\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The key the value was stored under using\n          Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting().\n    returns:\n      - type: Variant\n        summary: |\n          The value stored under the given key.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:PromptExperienceDetailsAsync\n    summary: |\n      Prompts a Class.Player with information about the specified experience.\n      The player can choose to teleport to the target experience through the\n      prompt.\n    description: |\n      Prompts the specified Class.Player with information of the specified\n      experience. The prompt includes the experience name, creator name,\n      maturity rating, etc. The prompt also includes a Join button which the\n      player can use to be teleported to the target experience. If the player is\n      ineligible to join the target experience, the button will be disabled.\n\n      Any teleport failures after the player clicks the Join button will\n      also fire Class.TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed providing a reason\n      for the failure.\n\n      #### Limitations\n\n      - For security purposes, teleporting a user from your experience to\n        another experience owned by others fails by default. See\n        here\n        for steps to enable cross-experience teleportation.\n      - This function currently can only be called from the client with\n        Class.Players.LocalPlayer as the player parameter.\n      - The join button will always be disabled during Studio playtesting; to\n        test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n        experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples:\n      - present-experience-details-page\n    parameters:\n      - name: player\n        type: Player\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player to be presented the prompt.\n      - name: universeId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Class.DataModel.UniverseId of the experience to be presented to the\n          Class.Player\n    returns:\n      - type: PromptExperienceDetailsResult\n        summary: |\n          Enum.PromptExperienceDetailsResult\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:ReserveServerAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns an access code that can be used to teleport players to a reserved\n      server, along with the Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId for it.\n    description: |\n      This function returns an access code that can be used to teleport players\n      to a reserved server, along with the server's\n      Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId. It can only be called on the server.\n\n      #### Reserved Servers\n\n      You can access reserved servers using:\n\n      - Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync() with the\n        Class.TeleportOptions.ReservedServerAccessCode parameter.\n      - Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer(), with the access code\n        ReserveServerAsync returns.\n        - A server is started when the access code is first used.\n        - Access codes remain valid indefinitely, meaning reserved servers can\n          still be joined if no game server is running (in this case a new\n          server will be started).\n\n      You can see if the current server is a reserved server by using the\n      following code:\n\n      lua\n      local isReserved = game.PrivateServerId ~= \"\" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId == 0\n\n\n      The Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId is constant across all server\n      instances associated with the server access code, the\n      Class.DataModel.JobId is not.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n\n      #### Cross-Platform Play\n\n      Players on Xbox and PlayStation with cross‑play disabled will arrive in a\n      different server than players with cross‑play enabled. This can cause\n      multiple game servers with the same\n      Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId|PrivateServerId to exist. You can use\n      Class.DataModel.MatchmakingType to differentiate these game servers.\n    codesamples:\n      - TeleportService-ReserveServer1\n      - teleportservice-teleport-to-a-reserved-server-via-chat\n    parameters:\n      - name: placeId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.DataModel.PlaceId of the place the reserved server is\n          being created for.\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: |\n          The server access code required by\n          Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer() and the\n          Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId for the reserved server.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:ReserveServer\n    summary: |\n      Returns an access code that can be used to teleport players to a reserved\n      server, along with the Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId for it.\n    description: ''\n    codesamples:\n      - TeleportService-ReserveServer1\n      - teleportservice-teleport-to-a-reserved-server-via-chat\n    parameters:\n      - name: placeId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.DataModel.PlaceId of the place the reserved server is\n          being created for.\n    returns:\n      - type: Tuple\n        summary: |\n          The server access code required by\n          Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer() and the\n          Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId for the reserved server.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:SetTeleportGui\n    summary: |\n      Sets the custom Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI that will be shown to the\n      local user during teleportation, prior to the teleport being invoked.\n    description: |\n      This function sets the custom Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI that will be\n      shown to the local user during teleportation, prior to the teleport being\n      invoked.\n\n      Note, the Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI will not be used if the\n      destination place is in a different game. It will also not persist across\n      multiple teleports and will need to be set prior to each one.\n\n      This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation\n      function is called from the server (as is the case with\n      Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()) then this function should be\n      called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to\n      a Class.RemoteEvent that fires several seconds before teleportation.\n\n      #### Loading screen\n\n      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the\n      customLoadingScreen is parented to the Class.CoreGui. Once the place\n      has loaded the Class.ScreenGui|loading screen is\n      Class.Instance.Parent|parented to nil.\n\n      This Class.ScreenGui can be fetched at the destination place using\n      Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui(), allowing you to parent\n      it to the Class.PlayerGui and perform your own transitions.\n\n      You are advised to also Class.Instance.Parent|parent the\n      Class.ScreenGui to the Class.PlayerGui in the start place while the\n      teleport is initiating.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples:\n      - teleporting-the-local-player\n    parameters:\n      - name: gui\n        type: Instance\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The loading Class.ScreenGui that is to be displayed during\n          teleportation.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting\n    summary: |\n      Stores a value under a given key that persists across all teleportations\n      in the same game.\n    description: |\n      This function stores a value under a given key that persists across all\n      teleportations in the same game.\n\n      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used\n      on the server.\n\n      The stored value can later be retrieved using\n      Class.TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting(). This will work in the\n      current place and any subsequent places the Class.Players.LocalPlayer\n      teleports to, provided they are in the same game.\n\n      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the\n      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting:\n\n      lua\n      local TeleportService = game:GetService(\"TeleportService\")\n\n      local isCrouching = false\n      TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting(\"isCrouching\", isCrouching)\n\n\n      The stored value can take one of the following forms:\n\n      - A table without mixed keys (all strings or all integers)\n      - A string\n      - A number\n      - A bool\n\n      If data is already stored under the given key, the previous value will be\n      overwritten by the new value.\n\n      #### Differences from GlobalDataStores\n\n      Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences\n      between teleport settings and datastores:\n\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync() stores the data on Roblox servers\n        whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally\n      - Data stored in a Class.GlobalDataStore is preserved after the user\n        leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores can only be accessed on the\n        server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client\n      - Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores have usage limits, whereas\n        teleport settings do not\n\n      In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side\n      information within a single play session across different places in a\n      game.

This is because\n      these functions can be called immediately without having to wait for this\n      event to fire.\n\n      This event should be connected immediately in a Class.LocalScript\n      parented to Class.ReplicatedFirst. Otherwise, when the connection is\n      made the event may have already fired.\n\n      #### Loading Screen\n\n      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the\n      customLoadingScreen is parented to the Class.CoreGui.

For example, using the following code inside a\n      Class.LocalScript in Class.ReplicatedFirst:\n\n      lua\n      local TeleportService = game:GetService(\"TeleportService\")\n      local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n      local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService(\"ReplicatedFirst\")\n\n      TeleportService.LocalPlayerArrivedFromTeleport:Connect(function(customLoadingScreen, teleportData)\n      \tlocal playerGui = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild(\"PlayerGui\")\n      \tReplicatedFirst:RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen()\n\n      \tcustomLoadingScreen.Parent = playerGui\n      \t-- animate screen here\n      \twait(5)\n      \t-- destroy screen\n      \tcustomLoadingScreen:Destroy()\n      end)\n\n\n      The customLoadingScreen will not be used if the destination place is in\n      a different game.\n\n      #### Studio Limitation\n\n      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;\n      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the\n      experience and play it in the Roblox application.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: loadingGui\n        type: Instance\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The customLoadingScreen the Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer\n          arrived into the place with.\n      - name: dataTable\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The teleportData the Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer arrived\n          into the place with.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities:\n      - Teleport\n  - name: TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed\n    summary: |\n      Fires when a teleport fails to start, leaving the player in their current\n      server.\n    description: |\n      This event fires on both the client and the server when a request to\n      teleport from a function such as Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()\n      fails and the player does not leave the current server. It provides a\n      reason for the failure, as well as all of the information necessary to\n      retry the teleport. If a group teleport fails, the event will fire once\n      per player.\n\n      #### TeleportOptions\n\n      The Class.TeleportOptions object provided by this event is not identical\n      to the one passed to the original Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()\n      call. It is a new object populated with the necessary parameters to retry\n      the teleport and send the player to the exact same destination.
