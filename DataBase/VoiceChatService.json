However, in the future,\n      Enum.AudioApiRollout|Automatic will become\n      Enum.AudioApiRollout|Enabled, so that new experiences can achieve\n      greater customization over voice.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: AudioApiRollout\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Audio\n      - Chat\nmethods:\n  - name: VoiceChatService:GetChatGroupsAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns chat group IDs that indicate which players can voice chat\n      together.\n    description: |\n      Returns a sorted array of arrays of chat group IDs for the given players.\n      Each chat group ID is a string that represents a communication-compatible\n      group within the current universe.\n\n      If two or more players share the same chat group ID, those players are\n      eligible to voice chat with each other based on their age-check status,\n      voice chat eligibility, and communication settings.\n\n      This method is server-side only and intended for real-time use cases such\n      as matchmaking and teleporting.
