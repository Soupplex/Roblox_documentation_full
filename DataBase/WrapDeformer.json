The\n  Class.MeshPart geometry is deformed according to the displacement between\n  pairs of Class.WrapTarget cage mesh vertices and Class.WrapDeformer cage\n  mesh vertices. Cage mesh vertices are paired based on UV equivalence.\n\n  Class.WrapDeformer may be used with avatars or on distinct\n  Class.MeshPart|MeshParts, as long as Class.WrapTarget children are present\n  for the parent Class.MeshPart|MeshParts. Class.WrapDeformer is similar to\n  Class.WrapLayer but doesn't require layered clothing and can directly deform\n  Class.MeshPart|MeshParts for publishing.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BaseWrap\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: WrapDeformer:CreateEditableMeshAsync\n    summary: |\n      Returns an Class.EditableMesh (currently unskinned) equivalent to the\n      deformed parent mesh.\n    description: |\n      Constructs and returns an Class.EditableMesh corresponding to the\n      deformed parent mesh geometry.
