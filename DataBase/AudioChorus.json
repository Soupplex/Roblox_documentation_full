It provides\n  one Input pin and one Output pin which can be connected to/from by\n  Class.Wire|Wires.\n\n  Class.AudioChorus is implemented by duplicating the input stream and\n  modulating the pitch of several delayed copies so that the overall result\n  sounds like a cloud of streams. If applied to a single voice, it may sound\n  like multiple voices.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: AudioChorus.Bypass\n    summary: |\n      Whether audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    description: |\n      If true, audio streams are passed-through unaffected by this effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Audio\n  - name: AudioChorus.Depth\n    summary: |\n      Controls the maximum delay time of the copied streams in the chorus\n      effect.\n    description: |\n      Controls how strong the chorus effect is by changing the maximum delay\n      time of the copy streams.
