When an event happens, the\n  Datatype.RBXScriptSignal fires and calls any listeners that are connected to\n  it. An Datatype.RBXScriptSignal may also pass arguments to each listener to\n  provide extra information about the event.\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors: []\nconstants: []\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: RBXScriptSignal:Connect\n    summary: |\n      Connects the given function to the event and returns an\n      Datatype.RBXScriptConnection that represents it.\n    description: |\n      Establishes a function to be called when the event fires.

Returns an\n      Datatype.RBXScriptConnection object associated with the connection. When\n      the event fires, the signal callback is executed in a desynchronized\n      state. Using ConnectParallel is similar to, but more efficient than,\n      using Connect followed by a call to Library.task.desynchronize() in\n      the signal handler.\n\n      Note: Scripts that connect in parallel must be rooted under an Actor.\n    parameters:\n      - name: func\n        type: function\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: RBXScriptConnection\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: RBXScriptSignal:Once\n    summary: |\n      Connects the given function to the event (for a single invocation) and\n      returns an Datatype.RBXScriptConnection that represents it.\n    description: |\n      Establishes a function to be called when the event fires. Returns an\n      Datatype.RBXScriptConnection object associated with the connection. The\n      behavior of Once is similar to Connect. However, instead of allowing\n      multiple events to be received by the specified function, only the first\n      event will be delivered. Using Once also ensures that the connection to\n      the function will be automatically disconnected prior the function being\n      called.\n    parameters:\n      - name: func\n        type: function\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: RBXScriptConnection\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: RBXScriptSignal:Wait\n    summary: |\n      Yields the current thread until the signal fires and returns the arguments\n      provided by the signal.\n    description: |\n      Yields the current thread until the signal fires and returns the arguments\n      provided by the signal.\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Variant\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\nfunctions: []\nmathoperations: []",
