Child UI\n  elements (the table cells) of these rows are then arranged in columns (within\n  rows). Each cell within a row has the same height, and each cell within a\n  column has the same width.\n\n  By changing the Class.UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection, sibling UI elements\n  can act as columns instead.\n\n  When applied, a UITableLayout will take control of sibling and cell elements'\n  Class.GuiObject.Size and Class.GuiObject.Position. Changing these in the\n  Properties window is still possible will not produce any effect.\n\n  Dimensions of the cells in the resulting table are controlled by the parent UI\n  element's dimensions. Unless Class.UITableLayout.FillEmptySpaceColumns or\n  Class.UITableLayout.FillEmptySpaceRows is enabled, the cell dimensions will\n  be that of the parent UI element (and thus tables with more than one cell\n  extend outside of their parent).\n\n  Cells will continue to respect Class.UISizeConstraint objects within them.\n  In other words, setting Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize on\n  Class.UISizeConstraint|UISizeConstraints within the header cells can\n  determine the size of the rest of the cells. If\n  Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize restricts a cell's size from filling the\n  allotted space (i.e. another row/column is wider than it), it will align to\n  the top-left.\ncodesamples:\n  - Build-UI-Table\ninherits:\n  - UIGridStyleLayout\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UITableLayout.FillEmptySpaceColumns\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether cells are sized such that they occupy the horizontal\n      space of the parent UI element.\n    description: |\n      FillEmptySpaceColumns determines whether cells' X size are set such that\n      the entire horizontal space of the parent UI element is used.
