Shirts cover the torso and arms, and will take priority over a\n  Class.Pants on the torso. To be visible, a Shirt must be a sibling of a\n  Class.Humanoid and have its Class.Shirt.ShirtTemplate|ShirtTemplate\n  property set to an appropriate texture such as rbxassetid://86896487. The\n  shirt texture may be colorized using the Class.Clothing.Color3 property.\n\n  Shirts are automatically loaded on Class.Player characters if their avatar\n  is wearing one.\ncodesamples:\n  - Shirt-Pants\ninherits:\n  - Clothing\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Shirt.ShirtTemplate\n    summary: |\n      Determines the texture of the Class.Shirt.\n    description: |\n      The content ID link pointing to the shirt template hosted on Roblox.\n\n      This content ID is different than the website URL of the shirt.
