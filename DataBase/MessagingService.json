Topics are\n  developer‑defined strings (1–80 characters) that servers use to send and\n  receive messages.\n\n  Delivery is best effort and not guaranteed. Make sure to architect your\n  experience so delivery failures are not critical.\n\n  Cross-Server Messaging\n  explores how to communicate between servers in greater detail.\n\n  If you want to publish ad-hoc messages to live game servers, or publish across\n  experiences, you can use the\n  Open Cloud APIs.\n\n  #### Limitations\n\n  Note that these limits are subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\tLimit\n  \t\t\tMaximum\n\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tSize of message\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t1kB\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tMessages sent per game server\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t 600 + 240  (number of players in this game server) per minute\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tMessages received per topic\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t(40 + 80  number of servers) per minute\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tMessages received for entire game\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t (400 + 200  number of servers) per minute\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tSubscriptions allowed per game server\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t 20 + 8  (number of players in this game server)\n\n\n\n\n  \t\t\t\tSubscribe requests per game server\n\n\n  \t\t\t\t 240 requests per minute\n\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: MessagingService:PublishAsync\n    summary: |\n      Invokes the supplied callback whenever a message is pushed to the topic.\n    description: |\n      This function sends the provided message to all subscribers to the topic,\n      triggering their registered callbacks to be invoked.\n\n      Yields until the message is received by the backend.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: topic\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Determines where the message is sent.\n      - name: message\n        type: Variant\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The data to include in the message.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - ServerCommunication\n  - name: MessagingService:SubscribeAsync\n    summary: |\n      Begins listening to the given topic.\n    description: |\n      This function registers a callback to begin listening to the given topic.\n      The callback is invoked when a topic receives a message. It can be called\n      multiple times for the same topic.\n\n      #### Callback\n\n      The callback is invoked with a single argument, a table with the following\n      entries:\n\n\n\n\n      \t\t\tField\n      \t\t\tSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n      \t\t\t\tData\n\n\n      \t\t\t\tDeveloper supplied payload\n\n\n\n\n      \t\t\t\tSent\n\n\n      \t\t\t\tUnix time in seconds at which the message was sent\n\n\n\n\n\n      It yields until the subscription is properly registered and returns a\n      connection object.\n\n      To unsubscribe, call Datatype.RBXScriptConnection|Disconnect() on the\n      returned object. Once called, the callback should never be invoked.\n      Killing the script containing the connections also causes the underlying\n      connect to be unsubscribed.\n\n      See also Class.MessagingService:PublishAsync() which sends the provided\n      message to all subscribers to the topic, triggering their registered\n      callbacks to be invoked.\n    codesamples:\n      - subscribing-to-cross-server-messages\n    parameters:\n      - name: topic\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Determines where to listen for messages.\n      - name: callback\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          Function to be invoked whenever a message is received.\n    returns:\n      - type: RBXScriptConnection\n        summary: |\n          Connection that can be used to unsubscribe from the topic.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - ServerCommunication\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
