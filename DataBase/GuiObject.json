It defines all the properties relating to the display\n  of a graphical user interface (GUI) object such as Class.GuiObject.Size|Size\n  and Class.GuiObject.Position|Position. It also has some useful read‑only\n  properties like Class.GuiObject.AbsolutePosition|AbsolutePosition,\n  Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize, and\n  Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteRotation|AbsoluteRotation.\n\n  To manipulate the layout of GUI objects in special ways, you can use a layout\n  structure such as list/flex or\n  grid, and you can style them beyond their\n  core properties through\n  appearance modifiers.\n\n  Although it's possible to detect mouse button events on any GUI object using\n  Class.GuiObject.InputBegan|InputBegan and\n  Class.GuiObject.InputEnded|InputEnded, only Class.ImageButton and\n  Class.TextButton have convenient dedicated events such as\n  Class.TextButton.Activated|Activated to detect click/press.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - GuiBase2d\ndescendants:\n  - CanvasGroup\n  - Frame\n  - GuiButton\n  - GuiLabel\n  - ScrollingFrame\n  - TextBox\n  - VideoDisplay\n  - VideoFrame\n  - ViewportFrame\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotBrowsable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: GuiObject.Active\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether this UI element sinks input.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the Class.GuiObject will sink input to\n      3D space, such as underlying models with a Class.ClickDetector class\n      like Class.DragDetector.\n\n      For Class.GuiButton objects (Class.ImageButton and\n      Class.TextButton), this property determines whether\n      Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated fires\n      (Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor|AutoButtonColor will still work for\n      those as well).
