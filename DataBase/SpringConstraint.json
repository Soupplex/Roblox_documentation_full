This constraint, along with a\n  Class.CylindricalConstraint, is ideal for building vehicle suspension.\n\n  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (A) to another part (B)\n  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (Z), part A will not\n  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Free Length\n\n  Class.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength defines the natural resting\n  length of the spring. If the attachments are further apart than the free\n  length, they are forced together; if the attachments are closer together than\n  the free length, they are forced apart.\n\n  #### Damping\n\n  The Class.SpringConstraint.Damping|Damping value controls how fast the\n  spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to oscillate\n  endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more quickly.\n\n  #### Stiffness\n\n  Class.SpringConstraint.Stiffness|Stiffness sets the strength of the spring.\n  Higher values create a spring that responds with more force when its\n  attachments are closer together or further apart than\n  Class.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength.\n\n  #### Limits\n\n  Enabling the Class.SpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled property\n  exposes the Class.SpringConstraint.MinLength|MinLength and\n  Class.SpringConstraint.MaxLength|MaxLength values for setting the minimum\n  and maximum length of the spring. If the spring's attachments reach these\n  limits, they stop moving apart from one another without restitution.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SpringConstraint.Coils\n    summary: |\n      The number of coils visualized on the Class.SpringConstraint.\n    description: |\n      The number of coils visualized on the Class.SpringConstraint.
