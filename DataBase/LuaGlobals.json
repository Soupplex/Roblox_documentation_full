If the\n      Class.ModuleScript has not been run yet, it will be executed.\n\n      If a string path is provided instead, it is first resolved to a\n      Class.ModuleScript relative to the script that called\n      Global.LuaGlobals.require(), mimicking the Unix-like semantics of Luau's\n      require() expression.\n\n      Specifically, require-by-string's resolution semantics are as follows:\n\n      - Paths with the ./ prefix begin resolution at script.Parent.\n      - Paths with the ../ prefix begin resolution at script.Parent.Parent.\n      - Paths with the @self/ prefix begin resolution at script.\n      - Paths with the @game/ prefix begin resolution at game.\n      - Each non-prefix component in a given path corresponds to a child\n        instance of the previous component. The exception to this is the ..\n        component, which corresponds to the parent of the previous component.\n      - If the desired Class.ModuleScript is not present at the time that\n        Global.LuaGlobals.require() is called, the call will fail and throw an\n        error. In other words, require-by-string is non-blocking: it does not\n        implicitly wait for a Class.ModuleScript to be created.\n\n      To illustrate this, each pair of Global.LuaGlobals.require() expressions\n      in the example below contains two functionally equivalent calls. Redundant\n      parentheses have been added to clarify exactly how each path component\n      maps onto an instance.\n\n      lua\n      -- \"./\" prefix is equivalent to script.Parent\n      require(\"./MySibling\")\n      require((script.Parent).(MySibling))\n\n      -- \"../\" prefix is equivalent to script.Parent.Parent\n      require(\"../SiblingOfMyParent\")\n      require((script.Parent.Parent).(SiblingOfMyParent))\n\n      -- \"../\" can be chained to go up multiple levels\n      require(\"../../SiblingOfMyGrandparent\")\n      require((script.Parent.Parent).(Parent).(SiblingOfMyGrandparent))\n\n      -- \"@self\" prefix corresponds to the script itself\n      require(\"@self/MyChild\")\n      require((script).(MyChild))\n\n      -- \"@game\" prefix corresponds to the DataModel root\n      require(\"@game/ReplicatedStorage/Shared/MyModule\")\n      require((game).(ReplicatedStorage).(Shared).(MyModule))\n\n\n      Once the return object is created by an initial\n      Global.LuaGlobals.require() call of a Class.ModuleScript, future\n      Global.LuaGlobals.require() calls for the same Class.ModuleScript (on\n      the same side of the client-server boundary) will not run the code again.\n      Instead, a reference to the same return object created by the initial\n      Global.LuaGlobals.require() call will be supplied. This behavior allows\n      for the sharing of values across different scripts, as multiple\n      Global.LuaGlobals.require() calls from different scripts will reference\n      the same returned object. If the returned object is a table, any values\n      stored within the table are shared and accessible by any script requiring\n      that Class.ModuleScript.\n\n      As noted above, the \"object sharing\" behavior does not cross the\n      client-server boundary. This means that if a Class.ModuleScript is\n      accessible to both the client and server (such as by being placed in\n      Class.ReplicatedStorage) and Global.LuaGlobals.require() is called\n      from both a Class.LocalScript as well as a Class.Script, the code in\n      the Class.ModuleScript will be run twice, and the Class.LocalScript\n      will receive a distinct return object from the one received by the\n      Class.Script.\n\n      Also note that if the Class.ModuleScript the user wants to run has been\n      uploaded to Roblox (with the instance's name being MainModule), it can\n      be loaded by using the Global.LuaGlobals.require() function on the asset\n      ID of the Class.ModuleScript, though only on the server.\n    parameters:\n      - name: module\n        type: ModuleScript | string | number\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.ModuleScript that will be executed to retrieve the return\n          value it provides, or a reference to one (a string path or asset ID).\n    returns:\n      - type: Variant\n        summary: |\n          What the Class.ModuleScript returned (usually a table or a\n          function).\n    tags: []\n    codesamples: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: select\n    summary: |\n      Returns all arguments after the given index.\n    description: |\n      Returns all arguments after argument number index.
