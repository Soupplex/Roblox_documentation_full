For example:\n\n\n      for , child in workspace:GetChildren() do\n          if child.ClassName == \"Part\" then\n              print(\"Found a Part\")\n              -- will find Parts in model, but NOT TrussParts, WedgeParts, etc\n          end\n      end\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Object.className\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This deprecated property is a variant of Class.Object.ClassName which\n      should be used instead.\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities: []\nmethods:\n  - name: Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal\n    summary: |\n      Get an event that fires when a given property of the object changes.\n    description: |\n      This method returns an event that behaves exactly like the\n      Class.Object.Changed|Changed event, except that it only fires when the\n      given property changes. It's generally a good idea to use this method\n      instead of a connection to Class.Object.Changed|Changed with a function\n      that checks the property name. Subsequent calls to this method on the same\n      object with the same property name return the same event.\n\n      Class.ValueBase objects, such as Class.IntValue and\n      Class.StringValue, use a modified Class.Object.Changed|Changed event\n      that fires with the contents of their Value property. As such, this\n      method provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those\n      objects.\n\n      Note that this event will not pass any arguments to a connected function,\n      so the value of the changed property must be read directly within a\n      script.\n\n      #### Limitations\n\n      The event returned by this method does not fire for physics-related\n      changes, such as when the Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame,\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity,\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity,\n      Class.BasePart.Position|Position, or\n      Class.BasePart.Orientation|Orientation properties of a Class.BasePart\n      change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider\n      using a physics-based event like Class.RunService.PreSimulation.\n\n      Additionally, the returned event may not fire on every modification of\n      properties that change very frequently, and/or it may not fire for such\n      properties at all. It's recommended that you carefully test for property\n      changes that impact game logic.\n    codesamples:\n      - Changed-Old-to-New\n      - Changed-and-GetPropertyChangedSignal\n    parameters:\n      - name: property\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The property to connect to.\n    returns:\n      - type: RBXScriptSignal\n        summary: |\n          A signal that fires whenever the property changes.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Object:IsA\n    summary: |\n      Returns true if an object's class matches or inherits from a given class.\n    description: |\n      IsA returns true if the object's class is equivalent to or a\n      subclass of a given class. This function is similar to the\n      instanceof operators in other languages, and is a form of\n      type introspection. To\n      ignore class inheritance, test the Class.Object.ClassName|ClassName\n      property directly instead. For checking native Luau data types (number,\n      string, etc) use the functions type and typeof.\n\n      Most commonly, this function is used to test if an object is some kind of\n      part, such as Class.Part or Class.WedgePart, which inherits from\n      Class.BasePart (an abstract class). For example, if your goal is to\n      change all of a character's limbs to the same color, you might use\n      Class.Instance:GetChildren()|GetChildren to iterate over the children,\n      then use IsA to filter non-Class.BasePart objects which lack the\n      Datatype.BrickColor property:\n\n      lua\n      local Players = game:GetService(\"Players\")\n\n      local function paintFigure(character, color)\n      \t-- Iterate over the child objects of the character\n      \tfor , child in character:GetChildren() do\n      \t\t-- Filter out non-part objects, such as Shirt, Pants and Humanoid\n      \t\t-- R15 use MeshPart and R6 use Part, so we use BasePart here to detect both:\n      \t\tif child:IsA(\"BasePart\") then\n      \t\t\tchild.BrickColor = color\n      \t\tend\n      \tend\n      end\n      paintFigure(Players.Player.Character, BrickColor.new(\"Bright blue\"))\n\n\n      Since all classes inherit from Class.Object, calling\n      object:IsA(\"Object\") will always return true.\n    codesamples:\n      - Instance-IsA1\n    parameters:\n      - name: className\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The class against which the Object's class will be checked.\n          Case-sensitive.\n    returns:\n      - type: boolean\n        summary: |\n          Describes whether the Object's class matched or is a subclass of the\n          given class.\n    tags:\n      - CustomLuaState\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Safe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Object:isA\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: className\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: boolean\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n      - CustomLuaState\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This deprecated function is a variant of Class.Object:IsA() which should\n      be used instead.\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\nevents:\n  - name: Object.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fires immediately after a property of the object changes, with some\n      limitations.\n    description: |\n      This event fires immediately after an object property is changed, with\n      some exceptions (see below). The new value of a changed property is\n      not passed as a parameter. Instead, you can access it using\n      object[property]:\n\n\n      object.Changed:Connect(function(property)\n      \tprint(\"The new property's value is\", object[property])\n      end)\n\n\n      - If you are only interested in listening for changes to one specific\n        property, consider using the\n        Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()|GetPropertyChangedSignal()\n        method instead.\n      - To listen for changes in attributes, see\n        Class.Instance:GetAttributeChangedSignal() and\n        Class.Instance.AttributeChanged.\n      - To detect when children are added or removed, see\n        Class.Instance.ChildAdded and Class.Instance.ChildRemoved.\n\n      For Class.ValueBase objects such as Class.IntValue and\n      Class.StringValue, this event only fires when the object's Value\n      property changes. To detect other changes in Class.ValueBase objects,\n      use Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()|GetPropertyChangedSignal().\n\n      #### Limitations\n\n      This event does not fire for physics-related changes, such as when the\n      Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame,\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity,\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity,\n      Class.BasePart.Position|Position, or\n      Class.BasePart.Orientation|Orientation properties of a Class.BasePart\n      change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider\n      using a physics-based event like Class.RunService.PreSimulation.\n      Similarly, the Changed event does not fire when\n      Class.BasePart.AssemblyMass|AssemblyMass updates due to a change in\n      material, size, or density for a welded part (but the event does fire for\n      Class.BasePart.Mass|Mass if you modify a part's size).\n\n      For properties that change frequently, the Changed event might not fire\n      for every modification, or it might not fire at all. If a property\n      change impacts your game logic, test carefully to ensure the event is\n      firing as you expect.\n    codesamples:\n      - Changed-Event\n      - Change-Detector\n    parameters:\n      - name: property\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The name of the property that changed.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities: []\ncallbacks: []",
