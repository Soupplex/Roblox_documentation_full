This will attempt to compute a valid path for\n  a character to move along, based on default or custom parameters passed to\n  Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()|CreatePath(). If\n  Class.Path:ComputeAsync()|ComputeAsync() successfully finds a path, the\n  Class.Path object will have a Class.Path.Status value of\n  Enum.PathStatus.Success. Otherwise the status will be\n  Enum.PathStatus.NoPath which can occur if there are obstacles between the\n  two points (and no way around) or if the points are inside of solid objects.\n\n  In addition to Class.Path:ComputeAsync()|ComputeAsync(), Class.Path\n  objects have the Class.Path:GetWaypoints()|GetWaypoints() method which\n  returns a list of waypoints representing the points a character should follow\n  in sequence to get from the beginning to the end of the path.\n\n  Finally, Class.Path objects can be connected to the Class.Path.Blocked\n  event. This event will fire if, at any time during the path's existence, the\n  path is blocked. Note that this can occur behind a character moving along\n  the path, not just in front of it.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Path.Status\n    summary: |\n      The success of the generated Class.Path.\n    description: |\n      The success of the generated Class.Path.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: PathStatus\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods:\n  - name: Path:CheckOcclusionAsync\n    summary: |\n      Checks if a path is blocked starting at a specific waypoint.\n    description: |\n      This function checks if a path is blocked starting at the waypoint\n      indicated by start.\n\n      It returns the first waypoint of occlusion if blocked, -1 if not. it\n      returns an error if start is less than 0 or greater than the number of\n      waypoints in the Class.Path.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: start\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: int\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This function has been superseded by the Class.Path.Blocked event which\n      you can connect to a Class.Path object and should be used instead.
