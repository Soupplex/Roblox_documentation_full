Most notably, it can apply a\n  set of Physically‑Based Rendering (PBR) texture images, or maps, on a\n  single object. Combining multiple texture maps can more accurately simulate\n  color, roughness, and reflectivity in any lighting environment and can enhance\n  the visual elements of your assets and environment; see\n  PBR Textures for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Appearance of this object on a Class.MeshPart depends on the user's device\n  and graphics quality level. For best results, you may want to preview your\n  content with different quality level settings.\n\n  Note that most Class.SurfaceAppearance properties cannot be modified by\n  scripts, as the necessary pre-processing is usually too expensive during\n  runtime.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.AlphaMode\n    summary: |\n      Determines how the alpha channel of the Class.SurfaceAppearance.ColorMap\n      is used.\n    description: |\n      This property determines how the alpha channel of the\n      Class.SurfaceAppearance.ColorMap is used.\n\n      When set to Enum.AlphaMode|Transparency and the\n      Class.MeshPart.Transparency is set to 0, opaque pixels in the\n      Class.SurfaceAppearance.ColorMap|ColorMap will render as completely\n      opaque in the 3D scene.

The metalness map is a grayscale image where black pixels\n      correspond to non-metals and white pixels correspond to metals.\n\n      Metals only reflect light the same color as the metal, and they reflect\n      much more light than non-metals. Most pixels in a metalness map will be\n      either pure black or pure white, while values in between can be used to\n      simulate dirt or grunge on top of an underlying metal area.\n\n      When Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale is 0, metalness has no\n      effect. For the most realistic reflections, it's recommended to set\n      Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale and\n      Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale to 1, as well as\n      Class.Lighting.Ambient and Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient to\n      (0, 0, 0).\n\n      See here for more\n      information.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.MetalnessMapContent\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.NormalMap\n    summary: |\n      Modifies the lighting of the surface by adding bumps, dents, cracks, and\n      curves.\n    description: |\n      This property modifies the lighting of the surface by adding bumps, dents,\n      cracks, and curves, without adding more polygons. The normal map is an RGB\n      image that modifies the surface's normal vector used for lighting\n      calculations. Its R, G, and B channels correspond to the\n      X, Y, and Z components of the local surface vector\n      respectively, and byte values of 0 and 255 for each channel correspond\n      linearly to normal vector components of -1 and 1.016 respectively. This\n      range is stretched slightly from -1 to 1 so that a byte value of 127 maps\n      to exactly 0.\n\n      The normal vector's Z axis is always defined as the direction of the\n      underlying mesh's normal. A uniform (127, 127, 255) image translates to\n      a completely flat normal map where the normal is everywhere perpendicular\n      to the mesh surface; this format is referred to as a \"tangent space\"\n      normal map. Note that Roblox does not support world space or object space\n      normal maps.\n\n      Incorrectly flipped normal components can make bumps appear like indents.\n      If you import a normal map and notice the lighting looks off, you may need\n      to invert the G channel of the image. The X and Y axes of the\n      tangent space frame correspond to the X and Y directions in the\n      image after it's transformed by the mesh UVs. If you view your normal map\n      in an image editor as if it were displayed on a surface, normals pointing\n      towards the right side of the screen should appear more red, and normals\n      pointing towards the top side of your screen should appear more green. The\n      terms \"DirectX format\" and \"OpenGL format\" are sometimes used to describe\n      whether the G channel of the normal map is inverted or not (Roblox\n      expects the OpenGL format).\n\n      Roblox also expects imported meshes to include tangents. Modeling software\n      may also refer to this as \"tangent space\" information. If you apply a\n      normal map and it does not seem to make any visual difference, you may\n      need to re-export your mesh along with its tangent information from the\n      modeling software.\n\n      See here for more\n      information.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.NormalMapContent\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.RoughnessMap\n    summary: |\n      Determines the apparent roughness across the surface.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the apparent roughness across the surface. The\n      roughness map is a grayscale image where black pixels correspond to a\n      maximally smooth surface, and white pixels correspond to a maximally rough\n      surface.\n\n      Note that surface roughness works on a very small scale. Reflections on\n      smooth surfaces are sharp and concentrated, while reflections on rough\n      surfaces are more blurry and dispersed.\n\n      See here for more\n      information.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: PluginSecurity\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.RoughnessMapContent\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Content\n    tags:\n      - Hidden\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceAppearance.TexturePack\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: ContentId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: RobloxScriptSecurity\n      write: RobloxEngineSecurity\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
