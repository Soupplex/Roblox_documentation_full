This\\n  allows for the creation of assemblies that continually rotate. It is the\\n  rotational counterpart to a Class.BodyVelocity. If you would like to\\n  maintain a constant angular displacement, use a Class.BodyGyro instead.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - BodyMover\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - Deprecated\\ndeprecationmessage: |\\n  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work.
