You might want to display a\\n  loading screen, preload critical assets, and only then allow the player into\\n  the experience.\\n\\n  #### Best Practices for Preloading\\n\\n  - Only preload essential assets, not the entire Class.Workspace. You\\n    might get occasional pop-in, but it decreases load times and generally\\n    doesn't disrupt the player experience. Assets that are good candidates for\\n    preloading include those required for the loading screen, the UI, or the\\n    starting area.\\n  - Let players skip the loading screen, or automatically skip it after a\\n    certain amount of time.\\ncodesamples:\\n  - ContentProvider1\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - NotCreatable\\n  - Service\\n  - NotReplicated\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: ContentProvider.BaseUrl\\n    summary: |\\n      Used by the Class.ContentProvider to download assets from the Roblox\\n      website.\\n    description: |\\n      Used by the Class.ContentProvider to download assets from the Roblox\\n      website.\\n\\n      This URL points to a Roblox hosted website from which assets are\\n      downloaded and is pulled from the AppSettings.xml file, located in the\\n      version-hash folder.\\n\\n      It is possible to overwrite this property using the\\n      Class.ContentProvider:SetBaseUrl() function in the command bar; however,\\n      this is not recommended and may cause asset loading issues.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: string\\n    tags:\\n      - ReadOnly\\n      - NotReplicated\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Data\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: false\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - AssetManagement\\n  - name: ContentProvider.RequestQueueSize\\n    summary: |\\n      Gives the number of items in the Class.ContentProvider request queue\\n      that need to be downloaded.\\n    description: |\\n      Gives the number of items in the Class.ContentProvider request queue\\n      that need to be downloaded.\\n\\n      Items are added to the client's request queue when an asset is used for\\n      the first time or Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync() is called.\\n\\n      Developers are advised not to use RequestQueueSize to create loading bars.\\n      This is because the queue size can both increase and decrease over time as\\n      new assets are added and downloaded.

Because the Class.Instance|Instances are not visible in\\n      these cases, the Engine may reduce memory consumption by unloading the\\n      textures after preloading them.\\n    codesamples:\\n      - ContentProvider-PreloadAsync1\\n    parameters:\\n      - name: contentIdList\\n        type: Array\\n        default:\\n        summary: |\\n          An array of instances to load.\\n      - name: callbackFunction\\n        type: Function\\n        default: nil\\n        summary: |\\n          The function called when each asset request completes.
