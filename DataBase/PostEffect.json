They change how the\n  world looks after it has been rendered. They do not affect\n  Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects. Objects of this kind should be parented to the\n  Class.Lighting or the Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera in order to work.\n\n  It should also be noted that some post-processing effects will work\n  differently or not at all when Roblox is set to a low\n  Class.RenderSettings.QualityLevel|QualityLevel (or\n  Class.RenderSettings.EditQualityLevel|EditQualityLevel in Studio). On some\n  low-end devices, faster rendering algorithms may be used. By default, these\n  quality settings are set to Automatic, so if you aren't seeing post-processing\n  effects you should check Roblox's settings under the \"Rendering\" section. It\n  may be necessary to override the automatic behavior temporarily in order to\n  preview post-processing effects.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants:\n  - BloomEffect\n  - BlurEffect\n  - ColorCorrectionEffect\n  - ColorGradingEffect\n  - DepthOfFieldEffect\n  - SunRaysEffect\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PostEffect.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Toggles whether or not the PostEffect is enabled.\n    description: |\n      Toggles whether or not the PostEffect is enabled.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: State\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Environment\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
