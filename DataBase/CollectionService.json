They are also serialized when places are saved.\\n\\n  The primary use of CollectionService is to register instances with specific\\n  tags that you can use to extend their behavior. If you find yourself adding\\n  the same script to many different instances, a script that uses\\n  CollectionService may be better.\\n\\n  Tags can be added or removed through this class' methods such as\\n  Class.CollectionService:AddTag()|AddTag() or\\n  Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()|RemoveTag(). They can also be managed\\n  directly in Studio through the\\n  Tags section of an instance's\\n  properties.\\n\\n  ##### Replication\\n\\n  When tags replicate, all tags on an instance replicate at the same time.\\n  Therefore, if you set a tag on an instance from the client then add/remove a\\n  different tag on the same instance from the server, the client's local\\n  tags on the instance are overwritten. In\\n  Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled|StreamingEnabled places, instances can be\\n  unloaded as they leave the client's streamed area. If such an instance\\n  re-enters the streamed area, properties and tags will be re-synchronized from\\n  the server. This can cause changes made by Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts to\\n  be overwritten/removed.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - NotCreatable\\n  - Service\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties: []\\nmethods:\\n  - name: CollectionService:AddTag\\n    summary: |\\n      Applies a tag to an Class.Instance.\\n    description: |\\n      This method applies a tag to an Class.Instance, doing nothing if the tag\\n      is already applied to that instance. Successfully adding a tag will fire a\\n      signal created by\\n      Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()|GetInstanceAddedSignal()\\n      with the given tag.\\n\\n      ##### Warnings\\n\\n      - An instance's tags that were added client-side will be dropped if the\\n        server later adds or removes a tag on that instance because the server\\n        replicates all tags together and overwrites previous tags.\\n\\n      - When tagging an instance, it is common that some resources are used to\\n        give the tag its functionality, for example event connections or tables.\\n        To prevent memory leaks, it's a good idea to clean these up (disconnect,\\n        set to nil, etc.) when no longer needed for a tag.
