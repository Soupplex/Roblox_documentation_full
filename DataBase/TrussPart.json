If you wish to create a\n  textured and \"climbable\" Class.BasePart but also utilize the climbing\n  behavior of TrussPart, consider setting the\n  Class.BasePart.Transparency|Transparency of the TrussPart to 1 to make\n  it invisible, set Class.BasePart.CanCollide|CanCollide on the\n  Class.BasePart to false, and then align the climbable surface of the\n  mesh/model with that of the TrussPart.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - BasePart\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TrussPart.Style\n    summary: |\n      Sets what the truss looks like.\n    description: |\n      Sets what the truss looks like, from the following options:\n\n      - Enum.Style.AlternatingSupports\n      - Enum.Style.BridgeStyleSupports\n      - Enum.Style.NoSupports\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Style\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Part\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
