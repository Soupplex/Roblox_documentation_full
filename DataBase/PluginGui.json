As of right\n  now, the only available PluginGui type is Class.DockWidgetPluginGui, but\n  there may be more in the future!\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - LayerCollector\ndescendants:\n  - DockWidgetPluginGui\n  - QWidgetPluginGui\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotReplicated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PluginGui.Title\n    summary: |\n      The title that is displayed above the contents of the Class.PluginGui.\n    description: |\n      The title that is displayed above the contents of the Class.PluginGui.\n      Defaults to empty string.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods:\n  - name: PluginGui:BindToClose\n    summary: |\n      Binds a function to the Class.PluginGui close button, overriding the\n      default behavior.\n    description: |\n      This function binds a function to the Class.PluginGui close button,\n      overriding the default behavior.\n\n      By default, when the user clicks the 'x' button in the top right corner of\n      the Class.PluginGui the Class.LayerCollector.Enabled|Enabled property\n      is set to false, closing the window. When a custom function is bound\n      using BindToClose this behavior is overwritten, allowing you to check if\n      the user really wants to close the window or give them an opportunity to\n      save their work.\n\n      As the default closing behavior is overwritten by this function, you'll\n      need to configure the Class.PluginGui to close manually by setting\n      Class.LayerCollector.Enabled|PluginGui.Enabled to false. For example,\n      in the below snippet users are required to click a confirm button to close\n      the GUI:\n\n      lua\n      local closing = false\n      pluginGui:BindToClose(function()\n      \t-- make sure we haven't already made a button\n      \tif closing then\n      \t\treturn\n      \tend\n      \tclosing = true\n\n      \t-- create confirm button\n      \tlocal confirmButton = Instance.new(\"TextButton\")\n      \tconfirmButton.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5)\n      \tconfirmButton.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)\n      \tconfirmButton.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)\n      \tconfirmButton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 0, 0)\n      \tconfirmButton.Text = \"Close?\"\n      \tconfirmButton.Parent = pluginGui\n\n      \t-- listen for click\n      \tconfirmButton.Activated:Connect(function()\n      \t\t-- close the gui\n      \t\tpluginGui.Enabled = false\n\n      \t\t-- remove confirm button\n      \t\tconfirmButton:Destroy()\n      \tend)\n      end)\n\n\n      You can call BindToClose with no argument to 'unbind' and revert to the\n      default behavior described above.
