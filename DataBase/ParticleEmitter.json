To emit and render particles, it must be parented to a\n  Class.BasePart or an Class.Attachment within such a part. When parented to\n  a Class.BasePart, particles spawn randomly within the part's bounding box or\n  shape; when parented to an\n  Class.Attachment, particles spawn from the attachment's position.\n\n  Particles emit automatically when the emitter is\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled|Enabled with a non-zero\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Rate|Rate, or manually when the\n  Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()|Emit method is called. With a non-zero\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed, particles are set in motion outwards\n  and/or inwards, depending on the Class.ParticleEmitter.ShapeInOut|ShapeInOut\n  property.\n\n  By default, particles face the camera, but the\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Orientation|Orientation can be modified to respect the\n  particle velocity instead.\n\n  During the Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime of the particles, they\n  can change appearance according to the Class.ParticleEmitter.Color|Color and\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Size|Size. Their motion can change over time according\n  to the Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag and\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Acceleration|Acceleration properties, and they can\n  also move as their parent moves when they are\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.LockedToPart|LockedToPart or have a non-zero\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance|VelocityInheritance.\n\n  To learn more about creating and customizing particle emitters, see\n  Particle Emitters.\ncodesamples:\n  - Creating-A-ParticleEmitter-from-Scratch\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: ParticleEmitter.Acceleration\n    summary: |\n      Determines the global-axis acceleration of all active particles, measured\n      in studs per second squared.\n    description: |\n      The Acceleration property determines how the\n      Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed of particles changes over their\n      lifetime.
