Multiple callbacks may share a priority, but then\n      their calling order is unpredictable. Each callback is intended to return\n      a response table with the same format as the response input table.\n      Callbacks shouldn't yield. The first callback invoked receives the\n      internal autocomplete's response as its response table, and subsequent\n      callbacks receive the previous callback's output as their response table.\n      Callbacks may either modify the passed table or return a new table of the\n      same format.\n\n      The callbackFunction must have the following type:\n      (Request: table, Response: table) -> table\n\n      The Request table has the following format:\n\n      lua\n      type Request = {\n        position: {\n          line: number,\n          character: number\n        },\n        textDocument: {\n          document: ScriptDocument?,\n          script: LuaSourceContainer?\n        }\n      }\n\n\n      - position is the one-indexed cursor position where you are\n        autocompleting.\n      - textDocument.document is the open Class.ScriptDocument you are\n        completing in, if it exists.\n      - textDocument.script is the Class.LuaSourceContainer you are\n        completing in, if it exists.\n\n      If both textDocument.document and textDocument.script are present,\n      then they correspond to each other:\n      req.textDocument.document:GetScript() == req.textDocument.script\n\n      The Response table has the following format:\n\n\n      type Response = {\n        items: {\n          {\n            label: string, -- The label\n            kind: Enum.CompletionItemKind?,\n            tags: {Enum.CompletionItemTag}?,\n            detail: string?,\n            documentation: {\n              value: string,\n            }?,\n            overloads: number?,\n            learnMoreLink: string?,\n            codeSample: string?,\n            preselect: boolean?,\n            textEdit: {\n              newText: string,\n              insert: { start: { line: number, character: number }, [\"end\"]: { line: number, character: number } },\n              replace: { start: { line: number, character: number }, [\"end\"]: { line: number, character: number } },\n            }?\n          }\n        }\n      }\n\n\n      - Response.items is an array of the completion items. The order of this\n        array is insignificant, and it resorts in the editor as the user types.\n      - Response.items[n].label is the label of the item which display in the\n        autocomplete menu.\n      - Response.items[n].kind specifies what type of autocomplete item this\n        is. Primarily this controls the icon given to the item in the editor.\n        Not all kinds have a unique icon. If not specified, the editor uses the\n        \"Text\" icon. Unsupported kinds default to displaying the \"Property\"\n        icon.\n      - Response.items[n].tags specifies an array of tags describing this\n        completion item. See the Enum.CompletionItemTag for details on their\n        function.\n      - Response.items[n].details specifies a string describing details about\n        the completion item. For default items, this is a string representation\n        of their type. Note that, in order for the documentation widget to\n        display, documentation must be present, but documentation.value may\n        be empty.\n      - Response.items[n].documentation specifies the main body of the\n        documentation in its value field. documentation is present, even if\n        value is empty, so the documentation window displays if either details\n        or overloads are specified.\n      - Response.items[n].overloads specifies the number of overloads of a\n        function autocompletion.\n      - Response.items[n].learnMoreLink links to a relevant page on the\n        creator docs. This URL must be a https request to create.roblox.com;\n        no other URLs display in the editor.\n      - Response.items[n].codeSample specifies a sample use of the completion\n        item. documentation must be non-empty to display this field.\n      - Response.items[n].preselect If true, the editor sorts this completion\n        item ahead of all others and selects it for the user by default. No\n        effect if false or missing.\n      - Response.items[n].textEdit If present, accepting the completion\n        applies this text edit - inserting or replacing the span between the\n        positions start and end with newText.\n\n      If a callback returns a malformed result or encounters an error, the\n      editor discards the modified Response table and uses the built-in\n      autocomplete result list.\n    codesamples:\n      - ScriptEditorService-RegisterAutocompleteCallback\n    parameters:\n      - name: name\n        type: string\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: priority\n        type: int\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: callbackFunction\n        type: Function\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: ScriptEditorService:RegisterScriptAnalysisCallback\n    summary: |\n      Registers a Script Analysis callback callbackFunction named name with\n      priority.\n    description: |\n      Registers a Script Analysis callback callbackFunction named name with\n      priority.
