The\n  length of the string can't be more than 200,000 characters; anything longer\n  causes a String too long error.\n\n  If the string is too long to be displayed in the Value field within the\n  Properties window, it shows partial string contents and an ellipsis (...).\n\n  Like all Class.ValueBase objects, this single value is stored in the\n  Class.StringValue.Value|Value property. The Changed event fires with the\n  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the\n  property being changed.\ncodesamples:\n  - Changed-Event\ninherits:\n  - ValueBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: StringValue.Value\n    summary: |\n      The stored string.\n    description: |\n      The stored string.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: StringValue.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fires whenever Class.StringValue.Value is changed.\n    description: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.IntValue.Value changes.
