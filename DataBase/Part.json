It comes in five different\n  primitive shapes: Ball, Block, Cylinder, Wedge, and CornerWedge.\ncodesamples:\n  - using-a-script-to-create-a-part\ninherits:\n  - FormFactorPart\ndescendants:\n  - FlagStand\n  - Platform\n  - Seat\n  - SkateboardPlatform\n  - SpawnLocation\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Part.Shape\n    summary: |\n      Sets the overall shape of the object.\n    description: |\n      The Shape property sets the overall shape of the object to one of a\n      predetermined list of built-in shapes.\n\n      The Enum.PartType enum controls the shape value, and has five possible\n      shapes:\n\n      | Shape/Value | Description                             |\n      | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |\n      | Ball        | A spherical shape.                      |\n      | Block       | A block shape.                          |\n      | Cylinder    | A cylinder shape.                       |\n      | Wedge       | A wedge shape with a slope on one side. |\n      | CornerWedge | A wedge shape with slopes on two sides. |\n\n      Class.MeshPart and solid modeling\n      can be used to obtain completely custom part shapes.\n\n      Collisions between balls, blocks, and wedges, and corner wedges are exact,\n      whereas collisions between terrain, cylinders, TriangleMeshes, and other\n      geometry types are approximations. This means that the ball shape can be\n      useful to create stable colliders for car wheels.\n    codesamples:\n      - using-a-script-to-create-a-part\n    type: PartType\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Part\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
