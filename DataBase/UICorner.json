Input, but not descendants, will be clipped to the\n  round corner area. See here for\n  examples.\n\n  In order to keep the circular shape of round corners with the\n  Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius value (Datatype.UDim), the radius\n  is internally calculated as follows:\n\n  - The radius of the X axis is always the same as the radius of Y axis.\n  - Datatype.UDim.Scale|Scale rounding will always apply to the minimum\n    width or height.\n  - Rounded rectangles will always be in a \"pill\" shape if\n    Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius is set to a value that leads to a\n    calculated result greater than half of the rectangle's minimum width or\n    height.\n\n  Alternatively, rounded corners can be accomplished using slices which are\n  suitable for decorative borders that are not simply rounded. See\n  9‑Slice Design for details.\n\n  Note that Class.UICorner can not be applied to a Class.ScrollingFrame.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - UIComponent\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: UICorner.CornerRadius\n    summary: |\n      Determines the radius of the component.\n    description: |\n      A Datatype.UDim property that determines the radius of the\n      Class.UICorner component, internally calculated as follows:\n\n      - The radius of the X axis is always the same as the radius of Y\n        axis.\n      - Datatype.UDim.Scale|Scale rounding will always apply to the\n        minimum width or height.\n      - Rounded rectangles will always be in a \"pill\" shape if\n        Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius is set to a value that leads\n        to a calculated result greater than half of the rectangle's minimum\n        width or height.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: UDim\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
