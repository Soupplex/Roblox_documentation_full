This enables the generation of objects like\n  environmental props in-experience, as well as fully functional models like\n  vehicles that drive, planes that fly, and weapons that shoot.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: GenerationService:GenerateMeshAsync\n    summary: |\n      Starts the generation of a new 3D mesh from a text prompt and returns\n      unique IDs used to track and retrieve the result.\n    description: |\n      Starts the generation of a new 3D mesh from a text prompt and returns\n      unique IDs used to track and retrieve the result.
