Unlike other\n  container classes like Class.Model, a folder generally offers no additional\n  functionality. Folders behave the same way as folders in a computer file\n  system, meaning they can also be parented to each other.\n\n  #### Usage in UI Hierarchies\n\n  Each Class.Folder in your UI hierarchy can define its own Class.UILayout\n  (Class.UIListLayout, Class.UIGridLayout, Class.UIPageLayout,\n  Class.UITableLayout), or use a default position-based layout. For example,\n  you can set up a Class.Frame with multiple Class.Folder children, each\n  with a different Class.UILayout type. Additionally, Class.Folder contents\n  are exempt from the effects of a Class.UILayout sibling.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
