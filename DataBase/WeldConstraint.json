Even if the two parts are not\n  touching, they can be welded together.\n\n  The most common way to create a weld constraint is by selecting Weld\n  through Studio's Create menu in the toolbar's Model tab.\n\n  Note that this tool behaves differently depending on how many\n  Class.BasePart|BaseParts are selected when the tool is activated:\n\n  - If no Class.BasePart|BaseParts are selected, the next two\n    Class.BasePart|BaseParts clicked will be connected by a new\n    Class.WeldConstraint. If the same Class.BasePart is clicked twice, no\n    constraint will be created.\n  - If one Class.BasePart is already selected, the next Class.BasePart\n    clicked will be connected to the selected one with a new\n    Class.WeldConstraint.\n  - If multiple Class.BasePart|BaseParts are selected, those which are\n    touching or overlapping will be automatically welded together by new\n    Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints.\n\n  #### Repositioning Behavior\n\n  Moving a welded Class.BasePart behaves differently depending on whether the\n  part was moved through its Class.BasePart.Position|Position or through its\n  Datatype.CFrame.\n\n  - If a welded part's Class.BasePart.Position|Position is updated, that part\n    will move but none of the connected parts will move with it. The weld will\n    recalculate the offset from the other parts based on the moved part's new\n    position.\n\n  - If a welded part's Datatype.CFrame is updated, that part will move and\n    all of the connected parts will also move, ensuring they maintain the same\n    offset as when the weld was created.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: WeldConstraint.Active\n    summary: |\n      Indicates if the WeldConstraint is currently active in the world.\n    description: |\n      True if the WeldConstraint is currently active in the world.\n\n      If the WeldConstraint or one of its parts is not in Class.Workspace the\n      weld will be inactive.\n\n      Rigid joints like Class.Weld, Class.Snap, Class.WeldConstraint,\n      Class.Motor, or Class.Motor6D may also be disabled due to conflicts\n      with other rigid joints, such as joints between the same two parts or\n      indirect cycles in the weld graph. Joints disabled this way may be\n      re-enabled later when another joint or part is added or removed.\n\n      Duplicate WeldConstraints do not conflict because WeldConstraints derive\n      their internal CFrames from the relative positions of their parts when\n      they are enabled and all update when Class.BasePart.Position or\n      Class.BasePart.Orientation is set on a part. The spanning tree may still\n      disable them if they are redundant or form a cycle.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: WeldConstraint.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Toggles the constraint on and off.\n    description: |\n      The Enabled property of a Class.WeldConstraint sets whether the\n      constraint is active or not.
