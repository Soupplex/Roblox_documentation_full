You can apply styling tags to Class.TextLabel, Class.TextButton, and Class.TextBox objects.\n\nEnable rich text\n\nYou must enable rich text on a per-object basis through its RichText property in the Properties window, or by setting the property to true in a Class.LocalScript.\n\nlua highlight=\"2\"\nlocal title = Instance.new(\"TextLabel\")\ntitle.RichText = true\n\ntitle.Text = \"Use a bold title\"\n\nWhen editing an object's Text property in Studio, toggling the RichText checkbox in the Properties window displays the text string as a final render. This is useful for identifying and correcting mistakes in any supported tags.\n\nLocalizing an experience to support other languages removes rich text formatting tags. To ensure formatting appears in other languages, re-apply the tags manually to your localized strings.\n\nSupported tags\n\nRich text tags are similar to XML/HTML tags and you must include both an opening and closing tag around the formatted text.\n\nFormatted text\n\nYou can also nest tags inside each other as long as you close them in the reverse order of how you opened them.\n\nFormatted text\n\nFont color\n\n\n\nI want the orange candy.\nI want the orange candy.\n\nFont size\n\n\n\nThis is big.
