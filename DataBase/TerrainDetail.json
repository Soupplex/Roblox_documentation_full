The\n  Class.MaterialVariant.BaseMaterial property of the parent MaterialVariant\n  object need to be one of the supported terrain Material, for example, it can\n  be Basalt but not Plastic.\n\n  Terrain renders with different textures for it's top(+y), bottom(-y), and\n  side(horizontal to y axis) faces. If a MaterialVariant has no TerrainDetail\n  children, all faces are rendered as MaterialVariant specified. At most 3\n  TerrainDetail objects can be added to MaterialVariant, one for each face.\n  TerrainDetail overrides the terrain appearance of a certain face.\n\n  For example, it can achieve this kind of effect: the top surface of Grass has\n  lots of grass. On side surfaces, there are less grass. On bottom surfaces\n  there are no grass.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TerrainDetail.ColorMap\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color of the surface.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the color of the surface.
