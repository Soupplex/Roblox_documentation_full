An object\n      that is a Class.GuiBase2d will not actually be automatically localized\n      unless Class.GuiBase2d.AutoLocalize is enabled.\n\n      The ordering of the tables is as follows:\n\n      - First, it looks for the earliest Class.GuiBase2d ancestor of the\n        object (including the provided object) that has a\n        Class.GuiBase2d.RootLocalizationTable.

For each child\n        Class.LocalizationTable of Class.LocalizationService, it appends\n        tables going up from the lowest descendant Class.LocalizationTable of\n        the tables parented to the service, all the way up to the children of\n        the service. If there are no children of Class.LocalizationService\n        that are Class.LocalizationTable|LocalizationTables, then no tables\n        append in this step.\n      - Finally, the cloud Class.LocalizationTable appends to the array. If\n        there is no cloud Class.LocalizationTable, or the cloud\n        Class.LocalizationTable has not yet loaded, then no table appends in\n        this step.\n\n      This function does not yield.

The entries\n      used for localization are the entries provided by the\n      Class.LocalizationTable hierarchy under Class.LocalizationService as\n      well as the cloud table (if available). This will be the same set of\n      entries returned by Class.LocalizationService:GetTableEntries(nil).\n\n      This function can error and thus should be wrapped in a pcall().\n\n      See also:\n\n      - Class.LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForPlayer() gets the translator\n        corresponding to the locale of the provided player.
