The number values are expressed using the\n  Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint type. This type is used in properties such\n  as Class.ParticleEmitter.Size and Class.Beam.Transparency to define a\n  numerical change over time.\n\n  #### Equality\n\n  Two Datatype.NumberSequence objects are equivalent only if the values of\n  their Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint are equivalent, even if both would\n  result in similar graphs.\n\n  #### Evaluation\n\n  The Datatype.NumberSequence type does not have a built-in method for getting\n  the value at a certain time/point because keypoints can have random envelopes.\n  However, assuming the envelope values of your keypoints are all 0, you can\n  use the following function to evaluate at a specific time.\n\n  lua\n  local function evalNumberSequence(sequence: NumberSequence, time: number)\n      -- If time is 0 or 1, return the first or last value respectively\n      if time == 0 then\n          return sequence.Keypoints[1].Value\n      elseif time == 1 then\n          return sequence.Keypoints[#sequence.Keypoints].Value\n      end\n\n      -- Otherwise, step through each sequential pair of keypoints\n      for i = 1, #sequence.Keypoints - 1 do\n          local currKeypoint = sequence.Keypoints[i]\n          local nextKeypoint = sequence.Keypoints[i + 1]\n          if time >= currKeypoint.Time and time  0.7\n\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  - name: NumberSequence.new\n    summary: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence with the start and end values set to the\n      provided n.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence with the start and end values set to\n      the provided n.\n\n        lua\n        local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new(n)\n        -- Equivalent to\n        local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new{\n            NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, n),\n            NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, n)\n        }\n\n    parameters:\n      - name: 'n'\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: NumberSequence.new\n    summary: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence of two keypoints with n0 as the start value\n      and n1 as the end value.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence of two keypoints with n0 as the start value\n      and n1 as the end value.\n\n        lua\n        local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new(n0, n1)\n        -- Equivalent to\n        local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new{\n            NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, n0),\n            NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, n1)\n        }\n\n    parameters:\n      - name: n0\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n      - name: n1\n        type: number\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n  - name: NumberSequence.new\n    summary: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence from an array of\n      Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint|NumberSequenceKeypoints.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a Datatype.NumberSequence from an array of\n      Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint|NumberSequenceKeypoints.
