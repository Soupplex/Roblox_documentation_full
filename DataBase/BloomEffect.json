It\\n  causes brighter colors to glow, similar to applying the neon\\n  Class.BasePart.Material|Material to everything, including the Class.Sky.\\n  Multiple BloomEffect objects can be applied at once and they will compose\\n  their effects together.\\n\\n  Like other post-processing effects, BloomEffect will only work while\\n  Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled and when parented to Class.Lighting or\\n  Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera. Also, it may render differently depending on\\n  your Studio settings (see the Quality Level settings in Rendering\\n  &rarr; Performance).\\n\\n  For more details on this effect and others, see\\n  Post-Processing Effects.\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - PostEffect\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: BloomEffect.Intensity\\n    summary: |\\n      Determines the additive blending intensity.\\n    description: |\\n      Intensity determines how intensely the colors that bloom (determined by\\n      the Class.BloomEffect.Threshold|Threshold) will additively blend with\\n      themselves.
