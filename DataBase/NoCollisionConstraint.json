Note that the tool acts differently based on\n  how many parts are selected when the tool is activated:\n\n\n\n\n      Option\n      Tool Behavior\n\n\n\n\n      No parts selected\n      The next two parts that are clicked will be linked together. If the same part is clicked twice, no link will be created.\n\n\n      One part selected\n      The next part that is clicked will be linked to the selected part.\n\n\n      Two parts selected\n      Both selected parts will be linked together.\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: NoCollisionConstraint.Enabled\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the two linked Class.BasePart|BaseParts will collide\n      with each other.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the two linked parts,\n      Class.NoCollisionConstraint.Part0|Part0 and\n      Class.NoCollisionConstraint.Part1|Part1, will collide with each other.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: NoCollisionConstraint.Part0\n    summary: |\n      The second Class.BasePart that the constraint connects.\n    description: |\n      The second Class.BasePart that the constraint connects.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: BasePart\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Parts\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\n  - name: NoCollisionConstraint.Part1\n    summary: |\n      The first Class.BasePart that the constraint connects.\n    description: |\n      The first Class.BasePart that the constraint connects.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: BasePart\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Parts\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Physics\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
