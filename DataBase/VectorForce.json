The\n  direction and strength of the force is determined by a Datatype.Vector3 and\n  can be relative to an attachment on the part, another attachment, or the world\n  coordinate system. Alternatively:\n\n  - Because the VectorForce constraint applies constant force and\n    acceleration, very high speeds may result if no other forces are involved.\n    If you want to maintain a more steady velocity over time, use a\n    Class.LinearVelocity constraint.\n  - If you only need initial velocity, set the\n    Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity property\n    directly on the assembly.\n\n  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study\n  Roblox Units to understand how Roblox units\n  compare to metric units.\n\n  #### Force Location\n\n  By default, force is applied to the assembly at the location of\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0. Thus, if its center of mass is not\n  aligned with the direction/point of force, torque will be applied as well. If\n  desired, force can be focused at the center of mass by toggling on\n  Class.VectorForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass.\n\n  #### Relativity\n\n  By default, force is applied relative to\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0. If the parent assembly rotates,\n  the force will change direction to match the adjusted orientation of the\n  attachment; visualize this behavior in how the thruster of a rocket pushes it\n  forward, regardless of the rocket's rotation.\n\n  If Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World, force will be applied in world coordinates,\n  independent of the parent or attachment orientations; visualize this behavior\n  as a directional force like the wind blowing against an object.\n\n  If Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo is set to\n  Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1, force will be applied relative to\n  Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1 and, if the attachment rotates, the\n  force will change to match its orientation.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Constraint\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: VectorForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass\n    summary: |\n      Whether force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly.\n    description: |\n      When true, force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly\n      of Class.VectorForce.Attachment0|Attachment0.
