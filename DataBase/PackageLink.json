This improves flows for\n  collaboration, version control, and sharing for models. The\n  Class.PackageLink instance will be a child of the root of the entire package\n  hierarchy.\n\n  Class.PackageLink|PackageLinks are not creatable through\n  Class.Script|Scripts. They can only be added through interaction with Studio\n  and can only be parented to Class.Instance|Instances that can be published\n  independently of Class.DataModel publish. The Class.PackageLink instance\n  will always be the first child shown in the tree view, regardless of sorting.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - NotBrowsable\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PackageLink.AutoUpdate\n    summary: |\n      When this property is set to true, the package associated with the given\n      Class.PackageLink automatically updates to the latest version.\n    description: |\n      When this property is set to true, the package associated with the given\n      Class.PackageLink will be automatically updated to the latest version.\n      By default, this property is false upon creation of a package.\n\n      This property lets you decide if a given package should be automatically\n      updated to the latest version when entering a given place.
