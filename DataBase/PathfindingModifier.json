When added as a child to a Class.Part, it takes\n  that Part's volume to annotate areas of the navmesh that are inside and on top\n  of it.\n\n  You can include pathfinding modifiers in the\n  Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath() parameters and compute smarter paths\n  across various materials or around defined regions.\n\n  Note that when adding a Class.PathfindingModifier to a part, either:\n\n  - The part is Class.BasePart.CanCollide|collidable and we are interested in\n    modifying pathfinding costs of paths on top of this part, which we call\n    area.\n  - The part is Class.BasePart.CanCollide|non-collidable (and usually\n    invisible in game) and we are interested in modifying pathfinding costs of\n    paths inside the part, which we call volume.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: PathfindingModifier.Label\n    summary: |\n      The name of the navigation area inside or on top of the Class.Part\n      volume.\n    description: |\n      The name of the navigation area inside or on top of the Class.Part\n      volume.\n\n      For a more detailed overview of Class.PathfindingService and\n      Class.PathfindingModifier, see\n      Character Pathfinding.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: PathfindingModifier.PassThrough\n    summary: |\n      Determines if the parts enclosed by the modifier are traversable, even if\n      they would normally be collided with.\n    description: |\n      Determines if the parts enclosed by the modifier are traversable, even if\n      they would normally be collided with.
