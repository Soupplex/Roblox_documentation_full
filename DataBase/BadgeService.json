Badges are used across the\n  platform to recognize a player's achievements and activity. Upon awarding a\n  badge to a player, it is added to their inventory and displayed on their\n  profile page.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods:\n  - name: BadgeService:AwardBadgeAsync\n    summary: |\n      Award a badge to a player given the ID of each.\n    description: |\n      Grants a Class.Player a badge with the Class.Player.UserId|UserId and\n      the badge ID.\n\n      In order to successfully award a badge:\n\n      - The player must be presently connected to the experience.\n      - The player must not already have the badge (note that a player may\n        delete an awarded badge from their profile and be awarded the badge\n        again).\n      - The badge must be awarded from a server-side Class.Script or a\n        Class.ModuleScript eventually required by a Class.Script, not from a\n        Class.LocalScript.\n      - The badge must be awarded in a place that is part of the experience\n        associated with the badge.\n      - The badge must be enabled; check this using the IsEnabled property of\n        the badge fetched through Class.BadgeService:GetBadgeInfoAsync().\n\n      Rate limit is 50 + 35  [number of users] per minute.\n    codesamples:\n      - badges---awarding-a-badge\n    parameters:\n      - name: userId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player.UserId of the user the badge is to be awarded to.\n      - name: badgeId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The ID of the badge to be awarded.\n    returns:\n      - type: boolean\n        summary: |\n          Boolean of true if the badge was awarded successfully.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - AssetManagement\n  - name: BadgeService:AwardBadge\n    summary: |\n      Award a badge to a player given the ID of each.\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: userId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The Class.Player.UserId of the user the badge is to be awarded to.\n      - name: badgeId\n        type: int64\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          The ID of the badge to be awarded.\n    returns:\n      - type: boolean\n        summary: |\n          Boolean of true if the badge was awarded successfully.\n    tags:\n      - Yields\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - AssetManagement\n  - name: BadgeService:CheckUserBadgesAsync\n    summary: |\n      Checks a list of badge IDs against a Class.Player.UserId|UserId and\n      returns a list of badge IDs that the player owns.\n    description: |\n      Checks a list of badge IDs against a Class.Player.UserId|UserId and\n      returns a list of badge IDs that the player owns.
