This property is particularly useful to\n      size containers of grids such as Class.Frame|Frames to make sure they\n      aren't any larger than the grid itself.\n\n      This property updates as soon as it's read. It will not fire a\n      Class.Object.Changed event immediately after the UI has changed, but if\n      the value is read, it will become current and a Class.Object.Changed\n      event will fire on the next render step.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Vector2\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection\n    summary: |\n      Determines the axis in which UI objects are laid out.\n    description: |\n      The FillDirection property determines the axis in which UI elements\n      are laid out. Enum.FillDirection.Horizontal arranges objects from left\n      to right, while Enum.FillDirection.Vertical arranges objects from top to\n      bottom. To reverse elements, such as to arrange right to left, you'll need\n      to reverse the sorting; for example by negating the child UI objects'\n      Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder values when\n      Class.UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder is set to\n      Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder.\n\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: FillDirection\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout.HorizontalAlignment\n    summary: |\n      Determines the horizontal alignment of UI elements within the parent\n      element.\n    description: |\n      The HorizontalAlignment property determines the X axis alignment\n      of the grid of UI elements, much like Class.TextLabel.TextXAlignment\n      does with Class.TextLabel.Text.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: HorizontalAlignment\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Alignment\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder\n    summary: |\n      Determines the order in which child UI objects are placed in a layout.\n    description: |\n      The SortOrder property determines the order in which child UI objects\n      are placed in a layout.\n\n      For Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder, an ascending sort is used on the\n      Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder|LayoutOrder property of child UI objects. If\n      two children share the same Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder|LayoutOrder,\n      whichever was added sooner to the parent object takes precedence.\n\n      For Enum.SortOrder.Name, an alphanumeric sort is used on the\n      Class.Instance.Name of the child UI objects.\n\n\n    codesamples: []\n    type: SortOrder\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Behavior\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout.VerticalAlignment\n    summary: |\n      Determines the vertical alignment of UI elements within the parent\n      element.\n    description: |\n      The VerticalAlignment property determines the Y axis alignment of\n      the grid of UI elements, much like Class.TextLabel.TextYAlignment does\n      with Class.TextLabel.Text.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: VerticalAlignment\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Alignment\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nmethods:\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout:ApplyLayout\n    summary: |\n      Force re-layout of sibling UI elements.\n    description: |\n      The ApplyLayout method forces sibling UI elements to be re-laid out in\n      case the sorting criteria may have changed (such as when\n      Class.UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder is set to Custom, and the\n      Class.UIGridStyleLayout:SetCustomSortFunction() behavior changed).\n      Re-layouts automatically happen when UI elements are added/removed, or\n      their Class.Instance.Name or Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder change.\n\n      The manner in which sibling UI elements are laid out is dependent on the\n      implementation of this abstract class. In other words, a concrete class\n      like Class.UIListLayout or Class.UIGridLayout is responsible for the\n      actual element positioning.\n    codesamples:\n      - UI-Sort-Order\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: UIGridStyleLayout:SetCustomSortFunction\n    summary: |\n      Sets the function used to determine the order of elements when SortOrder\n      is set to Custom.\n    description: |\n      This method is deprecated. Use Class.UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder\n      instead.\n\n      The function should take two arguments (each will be an Class.Instance\n      child to compare), and return true if a comes before b, otherwise return\n      false. In other words, use this function the same way you would use a '\n      function. The sorting should be deterministic, otherwise sort will fail\n      and fall back to name order.\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: function\n        type: Function\n        default: nil\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags:\n      - Deprecated\n    deprecationmessage: |\n      This method is deprecated in favor of using other SortOrder means, such as\n      by Name or LayoutOrder.\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
