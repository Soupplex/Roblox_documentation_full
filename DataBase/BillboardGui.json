The container's position is relative to the parent\n  Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment (or the\n  Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee). For Class.BasePart|BaseParts, the\n  Class.BasePart.Position|Position property is used, while for\n  Class.Attachment|Attachments, the\n  Class.Attachment.WorldPosition|WorldPosition property is used.\n\n\n\n  A billboard's Class.BillboardGui.Size|Size property works slightly\n  differently than Class.GuiObject.Size. While the offset components work\n  the same, the scale components are used as stud sizes in 3D space.\n\n  When creating a size-scaled Class.BillboardGui that contains a\n  Class.TextLabel, it's useful to enable the label's\n  Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextScaled property so that its text scales along\n  with the billboard canvas as the camera distance changes.\n\n  Note that interactive UI elements like Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons and\n  Class.TextButton|TextButtons inside a Class.BillboardGui will only receive\n  user input if they are parented to the Class.PlayerGui, typically via\n  placing the Class.BillboardGui inside Class.StarterGui. The\n  Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee property can be used to target a part or\n  attachment in the 3D world while the Class.BillboardGui itself remains in\n  the Class.PlayerGui.\n\n  See In-Experience UI\n  for a guide on working with Class.BillboardGui containers.\n\n  ##### Caching Behavior\n\n  To help improve performance, the appearance of a Class.BillboardGui is\n  cached until one of the following occurs, after which its appearance will be\n  recomputed on the next rendering frame.\n\n  - A descendant is added to or removed from the Class.BillboardGui.\n  - A property of a descendant of the Class.BillboardGui changes.\n  - A property of the Class.BillboardGui itself changes.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - LayerCollector\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: BillboardGui.Active\n    summary: |\n      Controls whether the descendants will receive input events.\n    description: |\n      Controls whether the descendants will receive input events. If the\n      Class.BillboardGui contains a Class.GuiButton, that button will become\n      clickable only if Class.BillboardGui.Active|Active is set to true on\n      both the Class.BillboardGui and the button.\n\n      Note that interactive UI elements like Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons\n      and Class.TextButton|TextButtons inside a Class.BillboardGui will only\n      receive user input if they are parented to the Class.PlayerGui,\n      typically via placing the Class.BillboardGui inside Class.StarterGui.\n      The Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee property can be used to target a\n      part or attachment in the 3D world while the Class.BillboardGui itself\n      remains in the Class.PlayerGui.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: BillboardGui.Adornee\n    summary: |\n      Sets the target part or attachment that the Class.BillboardGui is\n      positioned relative to.\n    description: |\n      Sets the target Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment that the\n      Class.BillboardGui is positioned relative to, overriding the parent part\n      or attachment.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Instance\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: BillboardGui.AlwaysOnTop\n    summary: |\n      Determines whether the Class.BillboardGui will always be rendered on top\n      of other 3D objects.\n    description: |\n      This property determines whether the Class.BillboardGui will always\n      render on top of other 3D objects.\n\n      When set to false (default), the Class.BillboardGui renders like other\n      3D content and is occluded by other 3D objects. When set to true, the\n      Class.BillboardGui always renders on top of 3D content and the\n      appearance changes significantly:\n\n      - Colors match how they appear inside a Class.ScreenGui.\n      - Text may appear sharper on high DPI devices.\n      - Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is treated as though\n        it's 0.\n      - Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness has no effect.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - UI\n  - name: BillboardGui.Brightness\n    summary: |\n      Determines the factor by which the Class.BillboardGui container's light\n      is scaled when Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 0.\n    description: |\n      This property determines the factor by which the Class.BillboardGui\n      container's light is scaled when\n      Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 0.
