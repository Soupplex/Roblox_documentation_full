If a SurfaceLight is parented\n  to a part, then the light will emanate from the part's selected face(s). If\n  parented to an attachment SurfaceLight is equivalent to a Class.SpotLight.\n\n  For more light types, please see the see also section.\n\n  ## See Also\n\n  - Class.PointLight\n  - Class.SpotLight\ncodesamples:\n  - surfacelight\ninherits:\n  - Light\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SurfaceLight.Angle\n    summary: |\n      The angle of which the light is shone from the SurfaceLight.\n    description: |\n      The angle of which the light is shone from the SurfaceLight.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceLight.Face\n    summary: |\n      Sets the side of the parent that the SurfaceLight comes from.\n    description: |\n      Sets the side of the parent that the SurfaceLight comes from.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: NormalId\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: SurfaceLight.Range\n    summary: |\n      The distance from the SurfaceLight's face that will illuminate.\n    description: |\n      The distance from the SurfaceLight's face that will illuminate.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
