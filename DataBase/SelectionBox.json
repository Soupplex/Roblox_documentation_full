The box's geometry consists of rectangular prisms forming an\n  outline/wireframe in addition to a surface for each of its faces.\n  SelectionBox does not capture any form of input; it is solely a visual\n  effect.\n\n  For an outline/fill overlay effect which covers non‑primitive geometry such as\n  that of a Class.MeshPart, see Class.Highlight.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - InstanceAdornment\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SelectionBox.LineThickness\n    summary: |\n      Determines the thickness of the boxes outlines, in studs.\n    description: |\n      LineThickness determines the thickness of the box's outlines, measured\n      in studs.
