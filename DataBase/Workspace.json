Objects\n  not descending from it will not be rendered or physically interact with the\n  world.\ndescription: |\n  The core job of Class.Workspace is to hold objects that exist in the 3D\n  world, effectively Class.BasePart|BaseParts and\n  Class.Attachment|Attachments. While such objects are descendant of\n  Class.Workspace, they will be active. For Class.BasePart|BaseParts, this\n  means they will be rendered, and physically interact with other parts and the\n  world. For Class.Attachment|Attachments, this means that objects adorned to\n  them, such as Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters, Class.Beam|Beams,\n  and Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis, will render.\n\n  Understanding this behavior is important, as it means objects can be removed\n  from Class.Workspace when they are not needed. For example, map\n  Class.Model|Models can be removed when a different map is being played on.\n  Objects that are not immediately needed in the 3D world are generally stored\n  in Class.ReplicatedStorage or Class.ServerStorage.\n\n  In its role as the holder of active 3D objects, Class.Workspace includes a\n  number of useful functions related to parts, their positions, and joints\n  between them.\n\n  ##### Accessing the Workspace\n\n  Class.Workspace can be accessed several ways, all of which are valid.\n\n  - workspace\n  - game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n  - game.Workspace\n\n  ##### Notes\n\n  - Objects that require adornment, such as\n    Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters and\n    Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis, will be at the\n    (0, 0, 0) position when parented to\n    Class.Workspace without an adornee otherwise being set.\n  - The Class.Model:MakeJoints() and Class.Model:BreakJoints() methods\n    inherited from the Class.Model class are overridden by\n    Class.Workspace:MakeJoints() and Class.Workspace:BreakJoints() which can\n    only be used in plugins.\n  - It is impossible to delete Class.Workspace.\n  - Class.Workspace automatically cleans up Class.BasePart|BaseParts that\n    fall beneath\n    Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight|FallenPartsDestroyHeight.\n  - A client's current Class.Camera object can be accessed using the\n    Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera property.\n  - The Class.Terrain object can be accessed using the\n    Class.Workspace.Terrain property.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - WorldRoot\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Workspace.AirDensity\n    summary: |\n      The air density at ground level, used in the aerodynamic force model.\n    description: |\n      The ground level (Y of 0) air density in RMU/stud&sup3; units (see\n      Roblox Units), used to calculate the\n      aerodynamic force if Class.Workspace.FluidForces is\n      Enum.FluidForces|Experimental. The default corresponds to realistic sea\n      level air density at standard temperature and pressure. Air density decays\n      as the Y altitude increases, reaching 5% of its ground level value at\n      100,000 studs.

If you set this\n      property to nil or to a camera that is not a descendant of the Workspace\n      (or the CurrentCamera is otherwise destroyed), a new Camera will be\n      created and assigned. Avoid these scenarios, as destroying the camera can\n      have unintended consequences.\n\n      For more information, see\n      Scripting the Camera.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: Camera\n    tags:\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities:\n      - Basic\n  - name: Workspace.DistributedGameTime\n    summary: |\n      The amount of time, in seconds, that the game has been running.\n    description: |\n      The amount of time, in seconds, that the game has been running.\n\n      Despite the title, this value is currently not 'Distributed' across the\n      client and the server.

When physics is being throttled, it will\n      update less frequently causing Class.BasePart|BaseParts to appear to\n      move slower.\n\n      Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out\n      of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other\n      undesirable behavior.\n\n      Objects associated with Class.Humanoid|Humanoids are exempt from physics\n      throttling.\n\n      See also Class.Workspace:SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled().\n\n      #### Demonstrating physics throttling\n\n      Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics\n      engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to\n      simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only\n      create a lot of Class.Part|Parts very quickly.\n\n\n      local Workspace = game:GetService(\"Workspace\")\n\n      local i = 0\n      while true do\n      \ti += 1\n      \tif i % 5 == 0 then\n      \t\ttask.wait()\n      \tend\n      \tlocal part = Instance.new(\"Part\", Workspace)\n      end\n\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: int\n        summary: |\n          The percentage of real time that physics simulation is currently being\n          throttled to.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Safe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Workspace:GetRealPhysicsFPS\n    summary: |\n      Returns the number of frames per second that physics is currently being\n      simulated at.\n    description: |\n      Returns the number of frames per second that physics is currently being\n      simulated at.\n\n      #### Using GetRealPhysicsFPS to combat exploiters\n\n      A common use of this function is to detect if exploiters are increasing\n      their local physics frame rate to move faster. This is generally done by\n      comparing the result returned by a client's GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum\n      that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If\n      this limit is breached, developers can use the Class.Player:Kick()\n      function to remove that Class.Player from the game. It is important to\n      remember that, although this practice may be effective sometimes,\n      client-side anti-exploiter measures are never 100% reliable.\n    codesamples:\n      - Workspace-GetRealPhysicsFPS1\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: double\n        summary: |\n          Returns the number of frames per second that physics is currently\n          being simulated at.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    threadsafety: Safe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Workspace:GetServerTimeNow\n    summary: |\n      Returns the server's Unix time in seconds.\n    description: |\n      This method returns the client's best approximation of the current time on\n      the server. It is useful for creating synchronized experiences, as every\n      client will get roughly the same results regardless of their timezone or\n      local clock.\n\n      This method returns a Unix timestamp, similar to Library.os|os.time(),\n      that you can use with Library.os|os.date() or\n      Datatype.DateTime.fromUnixTimestamp(). The timestamp is smoothed so\n      that:\n\n      - It is monotonic; its value will never decrease.\n      - It moves at the same rate as the local clock to within 0.6%.\n\n      This method is useful for making sure an event starts at the right\n      real-world time and for periodic adjustments to keep a series of events in\n      sync.
