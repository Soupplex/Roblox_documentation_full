It is similar to\n  Datatype.Vector2 in that it allows for the same arithmetic operations, but\n  it lacks commonly used vector functions.\n\n  Datatype.Vector2int16 should not be confused with:\n\n  - Datatype.Vector2, a more precise and complete implementation for 2D\n    vectors.\n  - Datatype.Vector3int16, a similar implementation for 3D vectors.\n\n  For each component:\n\n  - The lower bound is -215, or -32,768.\n  - The upper bound is 215 &minus; 1, or 32,767.\n\n  #### Converting to Vector2\n\n  To convert a Datatype.Vector2int16 to a Datatype.Vector2, construct a\n  Datatype.Vector2 by passing each component of the\n  Datatype.Vector2int16 to Datatype.Vector2.new():\n\n  lua\n  local vector2int16 = Vector2int16.new(1, 2)\n  local vector2 = Vector2.new(vector2int16.X, vector2int16.Y)\n  print(vector2)  --> 1, 2\n\n\n  Do not pass an entire Datatype.Vector2int16 to Datatype.Vector2.new(),\n  as the constructor interprets a Datatype.Vector2int16 as a 0 within its\n  parameters without producing an error. This can lead to silent logic\n  errors if you do something like:\n\n  lua\n  local vector2int16 = Vector2int16.new(1, 2)\n  local vector2 = Vector2.new(vector2int16)\n  print(vector2)  --> 0, 0\n\n\n  #### Math Operations\n\n  The following math operations are valid for the Datatype.Vector2int16 data\n  type. For all operations, be mindful of the bounds associated with signed\n  16-bit integers, described earlier.\n\n\n\n\n        Operation\n        Description\n\n\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16 + Datatype.Vector2int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the sum of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16 - Datatype.Vector2int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the difference of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16  Datatype.Vector2int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the product of the operands' respective components.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16 / Datatype.Vector2int16\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the quotient of the operands' respective components. The results of the\n      division are rounded down.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16  number\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the product of the respective Datatype.Vector2int16 components and the number (factor). This operation is commutative.\n\n\n        Datatype.Vector2int16 / number\n        Produces a Datatype.Vector2int16 whose components are the quotient of the respective Datatype.Vector2int16 components and the number (divisor). The results of the\n      division are rounded toward zero.\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nconstructors:\n  - name: Vector2int16.new\n    summary: Returns a Datatype.Vector2int16 from the given x and y components.\n    description: |-\n      Returns a new Datatype.Vector2int16 given the x and y components.
