Distant objects can be blurred or this effect can be used\\n  to focus on specific parts of a scene, like an item in an in-game shop.\\n\\n  Like other post-processing effects, DepthOfFieldEffect will only work\\n  while Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled and when parented to Class.Lighting\\n  or Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera. Also, it may render differently on low-end\\n  devices or depending on your Studio settings (see the Quality Level\\n  settings in Rendering &rarr; Performance).\\n\\n  For more details on this effect and others, see\\n  Post-Processing Effects.\\n\\n\\ncodesamples: []\\ninherits:\\n  - PostEffect\\ndescendants: []\\ntags: []\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: DepthOfFieldEffect.FarIntensity\\n    summary: |\\n      Intensity of the far field blur.\\n    description: |\\n      Intensity of the far field blur, moving out in distance from the\\n      Class.DepthOfFieldEffect.FocusDistance|FocusDistance point plus\\n      Class.DepthOfFieldEffect.InFocusRadius|InFocusRadius value.\\n\\n\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: State\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: DepthOfFieldEffect.FocusDistance\\n    summary: |\\n      Distance away from the camera where objects are in focus.\\n    description: |\\n      Controls the distance away from the camera (in studs) where objects are in\\n      focus.\\n\\n\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: float\\n    tags: []\\n    deprecationmessage: ''\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: State\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Environment\\n  - name: DepthOfFieldEffect.InFocusRadius\\n    summary: |\\n      Controls the distance away from the\\n      Class.DepthOfFieldEffect.FocusDistance|FocusDistance where no blur is\\n      applied.\\n    description: |\\n      Controls the distance away from the\\n      Class.DepthOfFieldEffect.FocusDistance|FocusDistance (on both sides)\\n      where no blur is applied.
