    "content": "In-experience UI containers hold Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects that you want to display within your experience's 3D world.\n\n- A Class.SurfaceGui allows for the rendering of UI objects onto a part's surface in the 3D world while also allowing for basic user interaction to occur.\n- A Class.BillboardGui is a container for UI objects to appear in the 3D space but always face the camera.\n\nSurface UI\n\nSimilar to Class.Decal|Decals and Class.Texture|Textures, UI objects such as Class.TextLabel|TextLabels and Class.ImageLabel|ImageLabels parented to a Class.SurfaceGui face the same direction as the surface they're on, editable through the Class.SurfaceGui.Face property.\n\nTo apply a Class.SurfaceGui to an in-experience Class.BasePart, simply parent it to that part and set the Class.SurfaceGui.Face property. Child UI objects then appear on that face of the parent part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can place the Class.SurfaceGui inside a container like Class.StarterGui and then set its Class.SurfaceGui.Adornee|Adornee property to any Class.BasePart, as well as the target Class.SurfaceGui.Face|Face. Setting Class.SurfaceGui.Adornee|Adornee overrides direct parent association, allowing for more flexibility in placement since it can be set from a script during runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive UI elements like Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons and Class.TextButton|TextButtons inside a Class.SurfaceGui will only receive user input if they are parented to the player's Class.PlayerGui, typically via placing the Class.SurfaceGui inside Class.StarterGui as noted above. Additionally, the part's Class.BasePart.CanQuery|CanQuery property must be true for the interactive UI element to receive input.\n\nTo assist in choosing the correct face for a Class.SurfaceGui, right-click the target part and select Show Orientation Indicator. This displays a blue circle with an F and a line attached to the object's Enum.NormalId.Front|Front face, and a green arrow that points in the direction of the object's Enum.NormalId.Top|Top face.\n\nSize and position\n\nThe \"canvas\" of a Class.SurfaceGui occupies the entire Class.SurfaceGui.Face|Face of the parent or Class.SurfaceGui.Adornee|Adornee part. As a best practice, it's recommended that you use scale values for the size and position of child UI objects like Class.ImageLabel|ImageLabels. You can also apply a Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint to children of the Class.SurfaceGui to maintain their desired aspect ratio regardless of the face's size.\n\nOcclusion mode\n\nThe Class.SurfaceGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop property determines whether the Class.SurfaceGui will render over top of 3D content or be occluded by it. When set to false (default), the Class.SurfaceGui renders like other 3D content and is occluded by other 3D objects. When set to true, it always renders over top of 3D content and it is not influenced by brightness/light in the 3D environment.\n\nBrightness and light influence\n\nClass.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness and Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence work in conjunction to determine how environmental light affects the UI content of the Class.SurfaceGui.\n\nClass.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness determines the factor by which emitted light is scaled in a range of 0 to 1000, letting you match the Class.SurfaceGui to its environment. For instance, a video billboard can be brightened inside a dark room by increasing Class.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness to 10.\n\nClass.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence controls how much the Class.SurfaceGui is influenced by lighting in the place, in a range from 0 to 1. Setting this to 1 means that surrounding lighting has complete control over the appearance, while setting it to 0 means that the lighting has no effect.\n\nNote that Class.SurfaceGui.Brightness|Brightness is inaccessible in Studio and has no effect when either Class.SurfaceGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 1 or Class.SurfaceGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop is true.\n\nDistance visibility\n\nClass.SurfaceGui.MaxDistance|MaxDistance controls how far from the camera the Class.SurfaceGui will be displayed before it stops rendering. A value of 0 means there is no limit and it will render infinitely far away. The default value of 1000 works fine for most cases.\n\nFor Class.SurfaceGui|SurfaceGuis that appear outdoors, it's recommended that Class.SurfaceGui.MaxDistance|MaxDistance is high enough to ensure that the container's UI is sufficiently small on the screen when it appears or disappears, minimizing the sudden pop‑in/out effect.\n\nDisplay order\n\nIf multiple Class.SurfaceGui containers exist on the same face, you can layer them by Z‑index through their Class.SurfaceGui.ZOffset|ZOffset property (changing this does not visually \"lift\" or \"sink\" the container from the surface).\n\nBillboard UI\n\nThe Class.BillboardGui container displays UI objects in the 3D space but, unlike Class.SurfaceGui, children of a Class.BillboardGui always face the camera. This container is useful for displaying front‑facing info above in‑experience objects such as health meters or names above player characters, markers to guide players to an object in the 3D world, and more.\n\nTo link a Class.BillboardGui to an in-experience Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment, simply parent it to that part or attachment and, if desired, adjust its size/position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can place the Class.BillboardGui inside a container like Class.StarterGui and then set its Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee property to any Class.BasePart or Class.Attachment. This method offers more flexibility in placement since Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee can be set from a script during runtime, for example to place a Class.BillboardGui over the head of player characters during runtime.\n\nInteractive UI elements like Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons and Class.TextButton|TextButtons inside a Class.BillboardGui will only receive user input if they are parented to the player's Class.PlayerGui, typically via placing the Class.BillboardGui inside Class.StarterGui as noted above.\n\nSize and position\n\nFor billboard sizing, the scale components of the Class.BillboardGui.Size|Size property set the billboard's stud size in 3D space. For example, a setting of {10, 0},{2, 0} (Datatype.UDim2.fromScale(10, 2)) forms a billboard with a 10:2 aspect ratio that scales larger or smaller depending on its distance from the camera.\n\nFor positioning, the Class.BillboardGui.StudsOffset|StudsOffset property shifts the billboard canvas on the X axis (left/right), Y axis (up/down), and Z axis (forward/back) relative to the camera.\n\nWhen creating a size-scaled Class.BillboardGui that contains a Class.TextLabel, it's useful to enable the label's Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextScaled property so that its text scales along with the billboard canvas as the camera distance changes.\n\nOcclusion mode\n\nThe Class.BillboardGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop property determines whether the Class.BillboardGui will render over top of 3D content or be occluded by it. When set to false (default), the Class.BillboardGui renders like other 3D content and is occluded by other 3D objects. When set to true, it always renders over top of 3D content and it is not influenced by brightness/light in the 3D environment.\n\nBrightness and light influence\n\nClass.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness and Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence work in conjunction to determine how environmental light affects the UI content of the Class.BillboardGui.\n\nClass.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness determines the factor by which emitted light is scaled in a range of 0 to 1000, letting you match the Class.BillboardGui to its environment. For instance, a video billboard can be brightened inside a dark room by increasing Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness to 10.\n\nClass.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence controls how much the Class.BillboardGui is influenced by lighting in the place, in a range from 0 to 1. Setting this to 1 means that surrounding lighting has complete control over the appearance, while setting it to 0 means that the lighting has no effect.\n\nNote that Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness is inaccessible in Studio and has no effect when either Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence is 1 or Class.BillboardGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop is true.\n\nDistance visibility\n\nClass.BillboardGui.MaxDistance|MaxDistance controls how far from the camera the Class.BillboardGui will be displayed before it stops rendering. A value of 0 or inf (default) means there is no limit and it will render infinitely far away.",
