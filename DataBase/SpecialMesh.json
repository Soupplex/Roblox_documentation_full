The SpecialMesh object also exposes the\n  Class.DataModelMesh.Offset property.\n\n  It is important to remember that when using a SpecialMesh, only the appearance\n  of a part changes. The collision model of the part remains the same. For\n  example, a character will not be able to walk correctly over a mesh as the\n  mesh geometry is not taken into account.\n\n  #### SpecialMesh vs MeshPart\n\n  There are currently two ways of using a developer created mesh. They are using\n  a SpecialMesh with the Class.SpecialMesh.FileType set to 'FileMesh', or by\n  using a Class.MeshPart. Although, on the whole, the Class.MeshPart object\n  has superseded the SpecialMesh there are some differences developers should be\n  aware of.\n\n  - Class.BasePart.Material displays correctly on the mesh when using a\n    Class.MeshPart and not when using a SpecialMesh\n  - Class.MeshPart|MeshParts include the Class.MeshPart.CollisionFidelity\n    property, meaning the collision model of a Class.MeshPart can be set to\n    resemble the geometry of the mesh. The SpecialMesh object by contrast, uses\n    the parent Class.BasePart|BaseParts collision model\n  - The mesh of a Class.MeshPart scales on all axis depending on the\n    Class.BasePart.Size|Size property of the Class.MeshPart, the mesh of a\n    SpecialMesh does not\n  - The SpecialMesh object includes the Class.DataModelMesh.Offset|Offset and\n    Class.DataModelMesh.Scale|Scale properties whereas\n    Class.MeshPart|MeshParts do not\n  - The Class.FileMesh.MeshId|MeshId property of a Class.SpecialMesh can be\n    changed by a Class.Script or Class.LocalScript during runtime. The\n    Class.MeshPart.MeshId|MeshId property of a Class.MeshPart can not.\ncodesamples:\n  - Mesh-Offset-and-Scale\n  - Mesh-VertexColor\ninherits:\n  - FileMesh\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: SpecialMesh.MeshType\n    summary: |\n      Determines the type of mesh that will be applied to the Class.BasePart\n      the Class.SpecialMesh is parented to.\n    description: |\n      The mesh that the Class.SpecialMeshobject applies to the\n      Class.BasePart depends on the MeshType property.
