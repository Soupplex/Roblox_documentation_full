For this\\n  reason, it's always advised to call Class.Instance:Destroy() on objects you\\n  no longer need. In some cases, however, an object may have a specific period\\n  of utility before it can be destroyed.\\n\\n  Consider a wall being smashed into individual bricks. If you want a brick to\\n  linger for 3 seconds before being destroyed, you can use the following code:\\n\\n  lua\\n  task.wait(3)\\n  brick:Destroy()\\n\\n\\n  However, waiting causes the thread to yield which may be undesired. To avoid\\n  yielding, a callback function can be scheduled to run on a new thread after 3\\n  seconds:\\n\\n  lua\\n  task.delay(3, function()\\n  \\tbrick:Destroy()\\n  end)\\n\\n\\n  Or in one line:\\n\\n  lua\\n  task.delay(3, brick.Destroy, brick)\\n\\n\\n  While this now avoids yielding, it has a potential drawback in that the\\n  scheduled callback will never run if the script is disabled or destroyed\\n  before the callback runs.\\n\\n  This is where Class.Debris has a specific advantage, as it does not yield\\n  the current thread and runs outside the context of the script, guaranteeing\\n  the instance is eventually destroyed even if the script is disabled or\\n  destroyed. The following code does not yield and guarantees the instance will\\n  be destroyed:\\n\\n  lua\\n  Debris:AddItem(brick, 3)\\n\\n\\n  Note that Class.Debris has a hardcoded maximum of 1,000 objects, so if more\\n  than 1,000 items are added, the oldest debris will be destroyed instantly to\\n  make room for new debris.\\ncodesamples:\\n  - Debris-AddItem\\ninherits:\\n  - Instance\\ndescendants: []\\ntags:\\n  - NotCreatable\\n  - Service\\ndeprecationmessage: ''\\nproperties:\\n  - name: Debris.MaxItems\\n    summary: |\\n      The maximum number of items that can be assigned to the Class.Debris\\n      service at one time.\\n    description: |\\n      The maximum number of items that can be assigned to the Debris service at\\n      one time.\\n\\n      If this number is exceeded, objects are automatically destroyed in order\\n      from oldest to newest until the amount is less than or equal to MaxItems.\\n\\n      This property is currently restricted and will error if set. The value is\\n      hardcoded to 1,000 items.\\n    codesamples: []\\n    type: int\\n    tags:\\n      - Deprecated\\n    deprecationmessage: |\\n      This property is deprecated and should not be used in new work.\\n    security:\\n      read: None\\n      write: None\\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\\n    category: Data\\n    serialization:\\n      canload: true\\n      cansave: true\\n    capabilities:\\n      - Basic\\nmethods:\\n  - name: Debris:AddItem\\n    summary: |\\n      Schedules a given Class.Instance for destruction within the specified\\n      lifetime.\\n    description: |\\n      Schedules a given Class.Instance for destruction within the specified\\n      lifetime.
