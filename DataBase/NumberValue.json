This stores a number in 64 bits (8\n  bytes) using the IEEE 754 representation (1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 52\n  fractional bits). Maximum and minimum values are\n  &PlusMinus;1.7976931348623157e+308, with a range of &PlusMinus;2^53 for exact\n  integer representations.\n\n  Like all Class.ValueBase objects, this single value is stored in the\n  Class.NumberValue.Value|Value property. The Changed event fires with the\n  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the\n  property being changed.\ncodesamples:\n  - Changed-Event\ninherits:\n  - ValueBase\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: NumberValue.Value\n    summary: |\n      Used to hold a double value.\n    description: |\n      Used to hold a double value.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: double\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\nmethods: []\nevents:\n  - name: NumberValue.Changed\n    summary: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.NumberValue.Value is changed.\n    description: |\n      Fires whenever the Class.NumberValue.Value changes.
