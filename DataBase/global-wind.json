    "content": "The Class.Workspace.GlobalWind|GlobalWind vector sets the direction and strength that wind blows through an experience, affecting terrain grass and dynamic clouds. You can set it as a constant vector, or adjust it through scripting to create cyclical gusts of wind. Additionally, you can influence particles to follow the global wind vector.\n\nGlobal wind vector\n\nGlobal wind is controlled through The Class.Workspace.GlobalWind|GlobalWind vector is a property of Class.Workspace and you can edit it directly in Studio, or set it through scripting.\n\nTo set the global wind vector in Studio:\n\n1. In the Explorer window, select the top-level Class.Workspace service.\n\n\n\n1. In the Properties window, locate the Class.Workspace.GlobalWind|GlobalWind property and set an X, Y, and Z value for its direction and strength.\n\n\n\nNote that the speed of animated grass — but not its vector direction — will be reduced if the player has toggled on the Reduce Motion accessibility setting from the Roblox or in‑experience Settings menu.\n\nParticle Influence\n\nParticles emitted by a Class.ParticleEmitter will follow the global wind vector as long as the emitter's Class.ParticleEmitter.WindAffectsDrag|WindAffectsDrag property is enabled and its Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag property is greater than 0. Class.Fire and Class.Smoke instances follow the wind vector by default.\n\nWind direction widget\n\nTo make it easier to tune global wind, you can use the Wind Direction widget, accessible from Studio's View menu. The widget lets you visualize how wind is blowing using a wind sock model, and you can dynamically set the wind's Speed, Yaw, and Pitch by clicking the desired aspect name and sliding the slider along the bottom, or you can adjust yaw or pitch by manipulating the green ring and blue arrow on the animated portion. You can also click and drag the widget to reposition it anywhere in the 3D viewport.\n\nScripted effects\n\nScripting of the Class.Workspace.GlobalWind|GlobalWind property opens up a whole range of possibilities. For example, you can use the following code sample to cause cyclical gusts of wind that ease in and out using the Library.math.sin() function.\n\nlua title=\"Script - Cyclical Wind Gusts\"\nlocal gustCycleDelay = 5  -- Max duration between gust cycles in seconds\nlocal gustCycleDuration = 3.5  -- Duration of each gust cycle in seconds\n\n-- During each gust cycle, a portion of \"gust\" will be added to \"baseWind\" in a ramped fashion\nlocal baseWind = Vector3.new(5, 0, 2)  -- Base wind speed and direction\nlocal gust = Vector3.new(25, 0, 10)  -- Gust speed and direction\nlocal gustIntervals = 100  -- Number of iterations used to calculate each gust interval\nlocal dg = gustCycleDuration / gustIntervals\nlocal dgf = dg / gustCycleDuration\n\n-- Set global wind to base wind initially\nworkspace.GlobalWind = baseWind\n\n-- Wait delay amount before starting gusts\ntask.wait(gustCycleDelay)\n\nwhile true do\n\tfor i = 1, gustIntervals do\n\t\tlocal f = math.sin(math.pi  dgf  i)  -- Use sin() function to ramp gust\n\t\tworkspace.GlobalWind = baseWind + f  gust  -- Set global wind to base wind + gust\n\t\ttask.wait(dg)\n\tend\n\tworkspace.GlobalWind = baseWind  -- Reset global wind to base wind at end of gust cycle\n\ttask.wait(math.random()  gustCycleDelay)  -- Wait a random fraction of delay before next gust cycle\nend",
