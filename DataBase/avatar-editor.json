The Avatar Editor Service can also access a user's inventory and the Marketplace to save outfits and purchase avatar items to the user's account.\\n\\nWe recommend implementing the Avatar Editor Service with an in-game avatar editor for a complete character customization experience. See the Simple Avatar Editor Demo reference place for an example of this feature.\\n\\nTo begin using the Avatar Editor Service, you must first request access to the user's inventory. After access is successfully granted, you can perform the following actions:\\n\\n- Read user's inventory to get a list of items owned by the user.\\n- Search the Marketplace, using a variety of properties to filter and sort.\\n- Equip avatar items and save outfits to the user's avatar.\\n- Prompt the user to purchase an Marketplace item.\\n\\nRequest access\\n\\nTo begin accessing a user's inventory, you need to prompt the user to allow access through Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptAllowInventoryReadAccess()|PromptAllowInventoryReadAccess(). You need to perform this request once per session.\\n\\nUse the following code sample to initiate the access prompt and listen for the user response:\\n\\nlua\\nlocal AvatarEditorService = game:GetService(\\\"AvatarEditorService\\\")\\n\\nAvatarEditorService:PromptAllowInventoryReadAccess()\\n\\nlocal result = AvatarEditorService.PromptAllowInventoryReadAccessCompleted:Wait()\\n\\nif result == Enum.AvatarPromptResult.Success then\\n  -- Access granted!\\nend\\n\\nThe user receives the following prompt:\\n\\nOnce the user accepts the prompt, the Class.AvatarEditorService can begin accessing the user's inventory.\\n\\nRead user inventory\\n\\nOnce access is granted by the user, you can read their inventory with the Class.AvatarEditorService:GetInventory()|GetInventory() function, supplying an array of Enum.AvatarAssetType|AvatarAssetTypes to filter by. This function returns an Class.InventoryPages object containing the user owned items.\\n\\nUse the following code sample to print a list of specific accessories in a user's inventory:\\n\\nlua\\nlocal AvatarEditorService = game:GetService(\\\"AvatarEditorService\\\")\\n\\nAvatarEditorService:PromptAllowInventoryReadAccess()\\n\\nlocal result = AvatarEditorService.PromptAllowInventoryReadAccessCompleted:Wait()\\n\\nif result == Enum.AvatarPromptResult.Success then\\n  -- Access granted!\\n  local assetTypes = {\\n    Enum.AvatarAssetType.BackAccessory,\\n    Enum.AvatarAssetType.ShoulderAccessory,\\n    Enum.AvatarAssetType.WaistAccessory\\n  }\\n  local pagesObject = AvatarEditorService:GetInventory(assetTypes)\\n  local currentPage = pagesObject:GetCurrentPage()\\n  for , item in currentPage do\\n    print(item)\\n  end\\nend\\n\\nSearch the Marketplace\\n\\nClass.AvatarEditorService includes functions and events which let you search the Roblox catalog. To search, supply your query with a Datatype.CatalogSearchParams object that includes one or more of the following properties:\\n\\n\\n    Property\\n    Description\\n\\n\\n\\n    AssetTypes\\n    An array of Enum.AvatarAssetType such as Enum.AvatarAssetType.BackAccessory.\\n\\n\\n    BundleTypes\\n    An array of Enum.BundleType such as Enum.BundleType.BodyParts.\\n\\n\\n    CategoryFilter\\n    A Enum.CatalogCategoryFilter describing the various catalog categories like \\\"Featured\\\" or \\\"Community Creations\\\". By default this is set to Enum.CatalogCategoryFilter.None\\n\\n\\n    MaxPrice\\n    An integer describing the maximum price to filter.\\n\\n\\n    MinPrice\\n    An integer describing the minimum price to filter. By default, MinPrice is 0.\\n\\n\\n    SearchKeyword\\n    A string to query against item descriptions in the catalog.\\n\\n\\n    SortType\\n    A Enum.CatalogSortType that describes how the results are ordered. By default this is set to Enum.CatalogSortType.Relevance.\\n\\n\\n    IncludeOffSale\\n    A boolean describing whether the results of the search include off sale items. By default this is set to false.\\n\\n\\n    CreatorId\\n    An integer to specify a given creator. You can use either a UserId or a GroupId.\\n\\n\\n  CreatorName\\n    A string used to search by items created by a given creator. You can use either a User Name or a Group Name.\\n\\n\\nThe following code sample constructs a Datatype.CatalogSearchParams object for Back and Shoulder asset types, and passes that through a Class.AvatarEditorService:SearchCatalog()|SearchCatalog() call:\\n\\nlua\\nlocal AvatarEditorService = game:GetService(\\\"AvatarEditorService\\\")\\n\\nlocal catalogSearchParams = CatalogSearchParams.new()\\nlocal assetTypes = {\\n  Enum.AvatarAssetType.BackAccessory,\\n  Enum.AvatarAssetType.ShoulderAccessory\\n}\\ncatalogSearchParams.AssetTypes = assetTypes\\n\\nlocal pagesObject =\\n--This function returns a CatalogPages object containing the results.\\nAvatarEditorService:SearchCatalog(catalogSearchParams)\\nlocal currentPage = pagesObject:GetCurrentPage()\\nfor , item in currentPage do\\n  print(item)\\nend\\n\\nSave avatars and outfits\\n\\nWhen used alongside an in-game avatar editor, Class.AvatarEditorService can save and update avatar items and outfits to the Roblox platform. Users don't receive catalog items they don't own when saving an avatar or outfit.\\n\\nAny Class.HumanoidDescription can be saved to the user's current avatar with Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptSaveAvatar()|PromptSaveAvatar(). This may include:\\n\\n- Pre-defined avatar configurations that you've built using existing catalog items.\\n- Any configuration that the user has chosen through an in-game avatar editor.\\n\\nSince Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptSaveAvatar() does not yield, you can get the result by listening to the Class.AvatarEditorService.PromptSaveAvatarCompleted event.\\n\\nThe following code will save a current Class.HumanoidDescription using Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptSaveAvatar()|PromptSaveAvatar() and checks for a successful Class.AvatarEditorService.PromptSaveAvatarCompleted event:\\n\\nlua\\nlocal AvatarEditorService = game:GetService(\\\"AvatarEditorService\\\")\\nlocal Players = game:GetService(\\\"Players\\\")\\n\\nlocal player = Players.LocalPlayer\\nlocal character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()\\nlocal humanoid = character:WaitForChild(\\\"Humanoid\\\")\\n\\nlocal currentDescription = humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()\\nAvatarEditorService:PromptSaveAvatar(currentDescription, humanoid.RigType)\\n\\nlocal result = AvatarEditorService.PromptSaveAvatarCompleted:Wait()\\nif result == Enum.AvatarPromptResult.Success then\\n  -- Avatar saved!\\nend\\n\\nTo save any Class.HumanoidDescription as an outfit (without overwriting the user's current avatar), use Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptCreateOutfit().\\n\\nOnce called, you can get the result of Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptCreateOutfit() by listening to the Class.AvatarEditorService.PromptCreateOutfitCompleted event.\\n\\nThe following code sample creates an outfit with Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptCreateOutfit() and listens for a successful Class.AvatarEditorService.PromptCreateOutfitCompleted event:\\n\\nlua\\nlocal AvatarEditorService = game:GetService(\\\"AvatarEditorService\\\")\\nlocal Players = game:GetService(\\\"Players\\\")\\n\\nlocal player = Players.LocalPlayer\\nlocal character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()\\nlocal humanoid = character:WaitForChild(\\\"Humanoid\\\")\\n\\nlocal currentDescription = humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()\\nAvatarEditorService:PromptCreateOutfit(currentDescription, humanoid.RigType)\\n\\nlocal result = AvatarEditorService.PromptCreateOutfitCompleted:Wait()\\nif result == Enum.AvatarPromptResult.Success then\\n  -- Outfit saved!\\nend\\n\\nPurchase items\\n\\nWhen saving either an avatar or an outfit that uses catalog items, the user doesn't receive any items that they do not own. Before saving an avatar or outfit, check if the user owns the asset with Class.MarketplaceService:PlayerOwnsAsset() and provide them with an option to purchase the item with Class.MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase().\\n\\nIf you don't wish to implement item purchases, you can instead allow users to favorite non-owned items with Class.AvatarEditorService:PromptSetFavorite().\\n\\n Be aware that you can't earn Robux commissions if the user decides to purchase those items outside of your experience.\",\n    \"source\": \"avatar-editor.md\"\n}",
