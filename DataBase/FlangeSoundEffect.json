It does this by copying the original audio signal\n  and playing on top of the original but slightly offset and modulated.\n\n  Like all other Class.SoundEffect, a FlangeSoundEffect can be applied either\n  to a Class.Sound or Class.SoundGroup by being parented to either.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - SoundEffect\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: FlangeSoundEffect.Depth\n    summary: |\n      The intensity of the effect.\n    description: |\n      Range: 0.01 to 1 (default 0.45) The intensity of the effect.
