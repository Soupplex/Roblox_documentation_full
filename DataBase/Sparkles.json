Like other particle\n  emitters of its kind, Sparkles objects emit particles when parented to a\n  Class.BasePart (such as a Class.Part) or an Class.Attachment within such\n  a Class.BasePart. Compared to the Class.ParticleEmitter class, Sparkles\n  lacks many different customization properties and special methods, such as\n  Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime or Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit(). It is\n  useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it\n  is preferable to use a Class.ParticleEmitter instead.\n\n  When Class.Sparkles.Enabled is toggled off, particles emit by this object\n  will continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Sparkles object's\n  Class.Instance.Parent is set to nil (and/or Class.Instance:Destroy()ed),\n  all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try\n  hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Sparkles\n  after a few seconds using Class.Debris to give the last particles a chance\n  to expire. This object does not have a Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear() method,\n  but it is possible to set the Class.Instance.Parent to nil and back to the\n  exact same object for the same effect.\n\n  Sparkles particles are only emitted from the center of Class.BasePart to\n  which they are parented. Parenting a Sparkles object to an Class.Attachment\n  instead allows customization of the particles' start position.\ncodesamples:\n  - Give-Sparkles\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags: []\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Sparkles.Color\n    summary: |\n      Determines the color of the sparkle particles.\n    description: |\n      The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a\n      Class.Sparkles object (both existing and future particles). It behaves\n      similarly to Class.ParticleEmitter.Color, except that it is only one\n      color and not a Datatype.ColorSequence.

Any particles already emit\n      will continue to render until their lifetime expires. This property is\n      useful for keeping pre-made sparkle effects off until they are needed\n      later. Since sparkle particles are destroyed when the Sparkle object's\n      Class.Instance.Parent is set to nil, this property is useful in\n      allowing existing particles the opportunity to expire before destroying\n      the Fire object altogether.
