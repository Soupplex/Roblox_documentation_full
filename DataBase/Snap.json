Most commonly created when\n  Class.BasePart:MakeJoints() is called on parts where Inlet and Stud\n  Enum.SurfaceType are touching.\n\n  Functionally identical to Class.Weld.\n\n  See also Class.WeldConstraint for a newer alternative using the\n  constraints system that does not\n  require Class.JointInstance.C0|C0 or Class.JointInstance.C1|C1 properties\n  to be manually set.\n\n  ## Root part\n\n  Every Assembly has a root part, see Class.BasePart:GetRootPart(). When a\n  Snap's Class.JointInstance.C0|C0/Class.JointInstance.C1|C1 is modified the\n  root part will stay where it was.\n\n  ## Directionality\n\n  Snaps do not have any directionality. Class.JointInstance.Part0|Part0 or\n  Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1, doesn't matter. You can imagine rigid\n  joints forming a tree branching down from the root part. All the parts down\n  the tree from root will move, and their welded \"children\" in this tree will\n  move with them.\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - JointInstance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Deprecated\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties: []\nmethods: []\nevents: []\ncallbacks: []",
