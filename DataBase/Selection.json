The\n  Class.Selection.SelectionChanged event fires whenever the current selection\n  changes.\n\n  For more information on using Class.Selection and Class.Plugin|Plugins,\n  see Class.Plugin.\n\n  Selection is also often used in the command bar, to set hidden properties or\n  run functions for selected Class.Instance|Instances.\n\n  Note this class only applies to Roblox Studio and has no applicability to\n  games.\ncodesamples:\n  - Selection1\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - NotCreatable\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: Selection.SelectionThickness\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    type: float\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Appearance\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: false\n    capabilities: []\nmethods:\n  - name: Selection:Add\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: instancesToAdd\n        type: Instances\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Selection:Get\n    summary: |\n      Returns an array of currently selected Class.Instance|Instances in\n      Roblox Studio.\n    description: |\n      Returns an array of currently selected Class.Instance|Instances in\n      Roblox Studio.\n\n      If no Class.Instance|Instances are selected, the array returned will be\n      empty. This function can be used in conjunction with the\n      Class.Selection.SelectionChanged event to get the selection whenever it\n      changes.\n\n      Note, this function can only be used in Class.Plugin|Plugins or the\n      command line.\n\n      For changing the current selection, please see Class.Selection:Set().\n    codesamples:\n      - Selection1\n      - Selection-SelectionChanged1\n    parameters: []\n    returns:\n      - type: Instances\n        summary: |\n          An array of currently selected Class.Instance|Instances.\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Selection:Remove\n    summary: ''\n    description: ''\n    codesamples: []\n    parameters:\n      - name: instancesToRemove\n        type: Instances\n        default:\n        summary: ''\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: Selection:Set\n    summary: |\n      Sets the currently selected objects in Roblox Studio to\n      Class.Instance|Instances in the given array.\n    description: |\n      Sets the currently selected objects in Roblox Studio to\n      Class.Instance|Instances in the given array.\n\n      Calling this function will cause the Class.Selection.SelectionChanged\n      event to fire, unless the new selection set is identical to the previous\n      selection.\n\n      Note this function overwrites the existing selection. However, using\n      Class.Selection:Get() an Class.Instance can be added to the existing\n      selection like so:\n\n\n      local selected = Selection:Get()\n      table.insert(selected, object)\n      Selection:Set(selected)\n\n    codesamples:\n      - SelectionSet1\n    parameters:\n      - name: selection\n        type: Instances\n        default:\n        summary: |\n          An array of Class.Instance|Instances to set the current selection\n          to.\n    returns:\n      - type: ()\n        summary: ''\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: PluginSecurity\n    threadsafety: Unsafe\n    capabilities: []\nevents:\n  - name: Selection.SelectionChanged\n    summary: |\n      Fires when the Class.Instance|Instances selected in Roblox Studio\n      changes.\n    description: |\n      Fires when the Class.Instance|Instances selected in Roblox Studio\n      changes.\n\n      Note this event does not give the new selection. Developers will need to\n      use the Class.Selection:Get() function to obtain the current selection.\n\n      Although this event can be used outside of plugins and the command bar, it\n      only applies to the selection in Roblox Studio and therefore has no\n      functionality outside of Studio.\n\n      To change the selection use the Class.Selection:Set() function.\n    codesamples:\n      - Selection-SelectionChanged1\n    parameters: []\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security: None\n    capabilities: []\ncallbacks: []",
