Macros are essentially substitutions for\n  large blocks of code that shouldn't need to be rewritten each time you want to\n  call them.\n\n  #### RBXCHECK\n\n  This macro does tests with calls to the Class.TestService:Check() function.\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tMacro\n  \t\tTest Condition\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECK(cond)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKMESSAGE(cond, failMsg)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKTHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == false\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKNOTHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKEQUAL(a, b)\n  \t\ta == b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKNE(a, b)\n  \t\ta ~= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKGE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKLE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKGT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt; b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXCHECKLT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt; b\n\n\n\n\n  #### RBXREQUIRE\n\n  This macro does tests with calls to the Class.TestService:Require()\n  function.\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tMacro\n  \t\tTest Condition\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRE(cond)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIREMESSAGE(cond, failMsg)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRETHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == false\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRENOTHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIREEQUAL(a, b)\n  \t\ta == b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRENE(a, b)\n  \t\ta ~= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIREGE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRELE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIREGT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt; b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXREQUIRELT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt; b\n\n\n\n\n  #### RBXWARN\n\n  This macro does tests with calls to the Class.TestService:Warn() function.\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tMacro\n  \t\tTest Condition\n\n\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARN(cond)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNMESSAGE(cond, failMsg)\n  \t\tcond == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNTHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == false\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNNOTHROW(CODE)\n  \t\tpcall(function() CODE end) == true\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNEQUAL(a, b)\n  \t\ta == b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNNE(a, b)\n  \t\ta ~= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNGE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNLE(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt;= b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNGT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &gt; b\n\n\n  \t\tRBXWARNLT(a, b)\n  \t\ta &lt; b\n\n\n\n\n  #### Additional Macros\n\n\n\n\n  Macro\n  Description\n\n\n\n\n  RBXERROR(msg)\n  Directly calls the Class.TestService:Error() function.\n\n\n  RBXFAIL(msg)\n  Directly calls the Class.TestService:Fail() function.\n\n\n  RBXMESSAGE(msg)\n  Directly calls the Class.TestService:Message() function.\n\n\n\ncodesamples: []\ninherits:\n  - Instance\ndescendants: []\ntags:\n  - Service\ndeprecationmessage: ''\nproperties:\n  - name: TestService.AutoRuns\n    summary: |\n      If set to true, the game will start running when the service's\n      Class.TestService:RunAsync() method is called.\n    description: |\n      If set to true, the game will start running when the service's\n      Class.TestService:RunAsync() method is called.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: boolean\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Physics\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: TestService.Description\n    summary: |\n      A description of the test being executed.\n    description: |\n      A description of the test being executed.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: string\n    tags: []\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Data\n    serialization:\n      canload: true\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: TestService.ErrorCount\n    summary: |\n      Measures how many errors have been recorded in the test session.\n    description: |\n      Measures how many errors have been recorded in the test session.\n    codesamples: []\n    type: int\n    tags:\n      - ReadOnly\n      - NotReplicated\n    deprecationmessage: ''\n    security:\n      read: None\n      write: None\n    threadsafety: ReadSafe\n    category: Results\n    serialization:\n      canload: false\n      cansave: true\n    capabilities: []\n  - name: TestService.ExecuteWithStudioRun\n    summary: |\n      When set to true, TestService will be executed when using the Run\n      action in Roblox Studio.\n    description: |\n      When set to true, TestService will be executed when using the Run\n      action in Roblox Studio.\n\n      Note that if the Class.TestService.NumberOfPlayers|NumberOfPlayers\n      property is set to a value above 0, running the game will open\n      NumberOfPlayers + 1 Studio windows where one window is a server and the\n      rest are players connected to that server.
